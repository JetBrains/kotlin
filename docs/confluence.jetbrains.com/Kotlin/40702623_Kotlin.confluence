Project [Kotlin] was born in [Saint Petersburg|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg], Russia, where one of the main [JetBrains'|http://jetbrains.com] development offices is located. [_Kotlin_|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_Island] is the name of an island situated nearby Saint Petersburg, in the Gulf of Finland, with a beautiful town of [Kronstadt|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronstadt] build upon the island. The current logo was inspired by the probably imagined connection of the word "Kotlin" with the word "Kettle", which was originally mentioned in the 1911 edition of Encyclopedia Britannica.

*Disclaimer 1*: We believe that no coffee or other exotic cultures are grown in Kotlin in any noticeable quantities.

*Disclaimer 2*: Despite the fact that [Kotlin Class Destroyers|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_class_destroyer] were named after the same island, our language is not intended for class destruction by any means.
