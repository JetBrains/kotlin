Usage: kotlinc-jvm <options> <source files>
where possible options include:
  -classpath (-cp) <path>    List of directories and JAR/ZIP archives to search for user class files.
  -d <directory|jar>         Destination for generated class files.
  -expression (-e)           Evaluate the given string as a Kotlin script.
  -include-runtime           Include the Kotlin runtime in the resulting JAR.
  -java-parameters           Generate metadata for Java 1.8 reflection on method parameters.
  -jdk-home <path>           Include a custom JDK from the specified location in the classpath instead of the default 'JAVA_HOME'.
  -jvm-target <version>      The target version of the generated JVM bytecode (1.8, 9, 10, ..., 22), with 1.8 as the default.
  -module-name <name>        Name of the generated '.kotlin_module' file.
  -no-jdk                    Don't automatically include the Java runtime in the classpath.
  -no-reflect                Don't automatically include the Kotlin reflection dependency in the classpath.
  -no-stdlib                 Don't automatically include the Kotlin/JVM stdlib and Kotlin reflection dependencies in the classpath.
  -script-templates <fully qualified class name[,]>
                             Script definition template classes.
  -Werror                    Report an error if there are any warnings.
  -api-version <version>     Allow using declarations from only the specified version of bundled libraries.
  -X                         Print a synopsis of advanced options.
  -help (-h)                 Print a synopsis of standard options.
  -kotlin-home <path>        Path to the Kotlin compiler home directory used for the discovery of runtime libraries.
  -language-version <version> Provide source compatibility with the specified version of Kotlin.
  -opt-in <fq.name>          Enable API usages that require opt-in with an opt-in requirement marker with the given fully qualified name.
  -P plugin:<pluginId>:<optionName>=<value>
                             Pass an option to a plugin.
  -progressive               Enable progressive compiler mode.
                             In this mode, deprecations and bug fixes for unstable code take effect immediately
                             instead of going through a graceful migration cycle.
                             Code written in progressive mode is backward compatible; however, code written without
                             progressive mode enabled may cause compilation errors in progressive mode.
  -script                    Evaluate the given Kotlin script (*.kts) file.
  -nowarn                    Don't generate any warnings.
  -verbose                   Enable verbose logging output.
  -version                   Display the compiler version.
  -J<option>                 Pass an option directly to JVM.
  @<argfile>                 Read compiler arguments and file paths from the given file.
