/kt49661.fir.kt:(273,274): error: Type argument for reified type parameter 'T' was inferred to the intersection of ['Foo' & 'Int']. Reification of an intersection type results in the common supertype being used. This may lead to subtle issues and an explicit type argument is encouraged.

/kt49661.fir.kt:(273,274): warning: Type argument for type parameter 'T' cannot be inferred because it has incompatible upper bounds: Foo, Int (multiple incompatible classes). This will become an error in a future release. See https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-51221.
