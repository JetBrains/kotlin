# Spec docs

This directory contains old language design documents, most of which **no longer correspond to the current state of Kotlin**.
These documents are left here temporarily, until we update and merge them into the official Kotlin specification.

Until then, please see [the official Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference) and [Kotlin Evolution and Enhancement Process](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/) for up-to-date documentation on topics highlighted here.
