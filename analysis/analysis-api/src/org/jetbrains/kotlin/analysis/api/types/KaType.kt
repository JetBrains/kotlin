/**
 * [KaType] represents a concrete Kotlin type, such as `Int`, `Foo` for a class `Foo`, or `Bar<String>` for a class `Bar<T>`. It provides
 * information about type structure, nullability, and annotations.
 *
 * The represented type may either be valid, or a [KaErrorType]. In that case, [KaErrorType] and the more specific [KaClassErrorType]
 * provide additional information about the nature of the type error, such as an [error message][KaErrorType.errorMessage].
 *
 * ### Structural and semantic equality
 *
 * [KaType.equals] implements *structural type equality*, which may not match with the usual intuition of type equality. Structural equality
 * is favored for `equals` because it is fast and predictable, and additionally it allows constructing a hash code. For semantic type
 * comparisons, [semanticallyEquals][org.jetbrains.kotlin.analysis.api.components.KaTypeRelationChecker.semanticallyEquals] should be used,
 * as it implements the equality rules defined by the type system.
 *
 * While structural equality lends itself well to usage of [KaType] as a key, avoid relying on hash maps to collect equal [KaType]s, as you
 * most likely want semantic equality in such cases. A possible alternative would be to use a hash map, but with a post-processing step of
 * comparing the map's keys with [semanticallyEquals][org.jetbrains.kotlin.analysis.api.components.KaTypeRelationChecker.semanticallyEquals]
 * to uncover additional equal types.

    /**
     * The abbreviated type for this expanded [KaType], or `null` if this type has not been expanded from an abbreviated type or the
     * abbreviated type cannot be resolved.
     *
     * An abbreviated type is a type alias application that has been expanded to some other Kotlin type. For example, if we have a type
     * alias `typealias MyString = String` and its application `MyString`, `String` would be the type alias expansion and `MyString` its
     * abbreviated type.
     *
     * The abbreviated type contains the type arguments of a specific type alias application. For example, if we have a
     * `typealias MyList<A> = List<A>`, for an application `MyList<String>`, `MyList<String>` would be the abbreviated type for such a type
     * alias application, not simply `MyList`.
     *
     * If this [KaType] is an unexpanded type alias application, [abbreviation] is `null`. Not all type alias applications are currently
     * expanded right away and the Analysis API makes no guarantees about the specific circumstances.
     *
     * While [abbreviation] is available for all [KaType]s, it can currently only be present in [KaClassType]s. However, abbreviated
     * types are a general concept and if the type system changes (e.g. with denotable union/intersection types), other kinds of types may
     * also be expanded from a type alias. This would allow more kinds of types to carry an abbreviated type.
     *
     * The [abbreviation] itself is always a [KaUsualClassType], as the application of a type alias is always a class type. It cannot be
     * a [KaClassErrorType] because [abbreviation] would then be `null`.
     *
     *
     * ### Resolvability
     *
     * Even when this [KaType] is an expansion, the abbreviated type may be `null` if it is not resolvable from this type's use-site module.
     * This can occur when the abbreviated type from a module `M1` was expanded at some declaration `D` in module `M2`, and the use-site
     * module uses `D`, but only has a dependency on `M2`. Then the type alias of `M1` remains unresolved and [abbreviation] is `null`.
     *
     *
     * ### Type arguments and nested abbreviated types
     *
     * The type arguments of an abbreviated type are not converted to abbreviated types automatically. That is, if a type argument is a type
     * expansion, its [abbreviation] doesn't automatically replace the expanded type. For example:
     *
     * ```
     * typealias MyString = String
     * typealias MyList<A> = List<A>
     *
     * val list: MyList<MyString> = listOf()
     * ```
     *
     * `MyList<MyString>` may be expanded to a type `List<String>` with an abbreviated type `MyList<String>`, where `String` also has the
     * abbreviated type `MyString`. The abbreviated type is not `MyList<MyString>`, although it might be rendered as such.
     *
     *
     * ### Transitive expansion
     *
     * Types are always expanded to their final form. That is, if we have a chain of type alias expansions, the [KaType] only represents the
     * final expanded type, and its [abbreviation] the initial type alias application. For example:
     *
     * ```
     * typealias Inner = String
     * typealias Outer = Inner
     *
     * val outer: Outer = ""
     * ```
     *
     * Here, `outer`'s type would be expanded to `String`, but its abbreviated type would be `Outer`. `Inner` would be lost.
