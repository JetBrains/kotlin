/**
 * A collection that holds pairs of objects (keys and values) and supports retrieving the value corresponding to each key,
 * checking if a collection holds a particular key or a value. Maps also allow iterating over keys, values or key-value pairs (entries).
 * Complex operations are built upon this functionality and provided in form of [kotlin.collections] extension functions.
 *
 * Map keys are unique; the map holds only one value for each key. In contrast, the same value can be associated with several unique keys.
 *
 * It is implementation-specific how [Map] defines key's uniqueness. If not stated otherwise, [Map] implementations are usually
 * distinguishing elements using [Any.equals]. However, it is not the only way to distinguish elements, and some implementations may use
 * referential equality or compare elements by some of their properties. It is recommended to explicitly specify how a class
 * implementing [Map] distinguish elements.
 *
 * It is also implementation-specific how [Map] handles `null` keys and values: some [Map] implementations may support them, while
 * other may not. It is recommended to explicitly define key/value nullability policy when implementing [Map].
 *
 * Unlike [Collection] implementations, [Map] implementations must override [Any.toString], [Any.equals] and [Any.hashCode] functions
 * and provide implementations such that:
 * - [Map.toString] should return a string containing string representation of contained key-value pairs in iteration order.
 * - [Map.equals] should consider two maps equal if and only if they contain the same keys and values associated with these keys
 *   are equal. Unlike some other `equals` implementations, [Map.equals] should consider two maps equal even
 *   if they are instances of different classes; the only requirement here is that both maps have to implement [Map] interface.
 * - [Map.hashCode] should be computed as a sum of [Entry] hash codes, and entry's hash code should be computed as exclusive or (XOR) of
 *   hash codes corresponding to a key and a value:
 *   ```kotlin
 *   var hashCode: Int = 0
 *   for ((k, v) in entries) hashCode += k.hashCode() ^ v.hashCode()
 *   ```
 *
 * Functions in this interface support only read-only access to the map; read-write access is supported through
 * the [MutableMap] interface.
 *
 * @param K the type of map keys. The map is invariant in its key type, as it
 *          can accept a key as a parameter (of [containsKey] for example) and return it in a [keys] set.
 * @param V the type of map values. The map is covariant in its value type.
