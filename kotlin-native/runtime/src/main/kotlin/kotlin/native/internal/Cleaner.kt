public interface Cleaner

/**
 * Creates an object with a cleanup associated.
 *
 * After the resulting object ("cleaner") gets deallocated by memory manager,
 * [block] is eventually called once with [argument].
 *
 * Example of usage:
 * ```
 * class ResourceWrapper {
 *     private val resource = Resource()
 *
 *     private val cleaner = createCleaner(resource) { it.dispose() }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When `ResourceWrapper` becomes unused and gets deallocated, its `cleaner`
 * is also deallocated, and the resource is disposed later.
 *
 * It is not specified which thread runs [block], as well as whether two or more
 * blocks from different cleaners can be run in parallel.
 *
 * Note: if [argument] refers (directly or indirectly) the cleaner, then both
 * might leak, and the [block] will not be called in this case.
 * For example, the code below has a leak:
 * ```
 * class LeakingResourceWrapper {
 *     private val resource = Resource()
 *     private val cleaner = createCleaner(this) { it.resource.dispose() }
 * }
 * ```
 * In this case cleaner's argument (`LeakingResourceWrapper`) can't be deallocated
 * until cleaner's block is executed, which can happen only strictly after
 * the cleaner is deallocated, which can't happen until `LeakingResourceWrapper`
 * is deallocated. So the requirements on object deallocations are contradictory
 * in this case, which can't be handled gracefully. The cleaner's block
 * is not executed then, and cleaner and its argument might leak
 * (depending on the implementation).
 *
 * [block] should not use `@ThreadLocal` globals, because it may
 * be executed on a different thread.
 *
 * If [block] throws an exception, the behavior is unspecified.
 *
 * Cleaners should not be kept in globals, because if cleaner is not deallocated
 * before exiting main(), it'll never get executed.
 * Use `Platform.isCleanersLeakCheckerActive` to warn about unexecuted cleaners.
 *
 * If cleaners are not GC'd before main() exits, then it's not guaranteed that
 * they will be run. Moreover, it depends on `Platform.isCleanersLeakCheckerActive`.
 * With the checker enabled, cleaners will be run (and therefore not reported as
 * unexecuted cleaners); with the checker disabled - they might not get run.
 *
 * @param argument must be shareable
 * @param block must not capture anything
