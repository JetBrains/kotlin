# Kotlin Analysis API

The Kotlin Analysis API is a library for analyzing Kotlin code at the semantic level. It provides a structured way to query information
about Kotlin code, including symbols, types, and semantic relationships between them. Built on top of Kotlin's
[PSI](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/psi.html) syntax trees, the API offers a clean abstraction over the compiler's internal
representations, making it accessible both for IDE plugin makers and command-line tool developers.

Check the [Analysis API documentation](https://kotl.in/analysis-api) for more information.

If you'd like to contribute to the project, please read the [Analysis API development guidelines](../docs/contribution-guide/index.md).
