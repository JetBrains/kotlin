# Type inference for calls

## Intro

Type inference is a quite broad topic, and here we focus only on the type inference for calls, i.e., on the algorithm trying to guess which
type arguments would fit properly for a given call if they're not specified explicitly.

For example, in the case of a call `listOf("")`, it would be quite nice to understand that the user expects it to work the same way as
`listOf<String>("")`.

All other cases of type inference, e.g., property type inference like `val x = ""` is beside the scope of the document.

**TODO**: For the sake of simplicity, we don't cover callable references here, shall be done later.

### Given input

Let's assume that we've got some independent call on a statement level inside the body block:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    listOf("")
}
```

- And some candidate with the appropriate value arguments number has already been chosen.
- But the candidate function has its type parameters, for which type arguments aren't specified.

In general, the situation might be a bit more complicated.

The independent call may have dependent call-arguments (see [Call tree](#call-tree)):

```kotlin
fun <K> materialize(): K = TODO()

fun main() {
    listOf("", materialize())
}
```

Or it might have lambdas and/or expected type

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val x: List<Any> = listOf("", run { 1 })
}
```

### Expected output

- For all calls in the call-tree, for each type parameter, there should be a type argument chosen.
- For all lambdas, all receiver/parameter/return types should be computed.

**TODO:** Cover how we infer the function kind of lambda (regular/suspend/compose).

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val x: List<Any> = listOf<Any>("", run<Int>(fun(): Int = 1))
}
```

Or, if there are some type contradictions, the error should be reported.

### Naive algorithm description

The idea of this part is to give some basic idea of how the algorithm works:

- At first step, we create a constraint system ([CS](#cs--constraint-system)) with type variables associated with all type parameters in the
  call-tree.
- Gather type variables constraints from the call tree (e.g. `Tv <: String` in `listOf("")`).
- Analyze lambdas' bodies after choosing types of their parameters (once it's possible).
- For each type variable, from the gathered constraints, choose the most reasonable resulting type.

## Detailed description

In general, the call resolution algorithm works in a very natural recursive manner:

- During body resolution, when we recursively traverse the AST and meet a call, before doing something, we would recursively resolve
  its receiver and arguments.
- But the arguments are being resolved in a special way, so the algorithm is aware that it's ok if some information (from an expected type)
  is missing, so it leaves them partially resolved until the resolution of the top-level call begins.
- So, when we start the actual Resolution & Inference process, the argument-calls have their own chosen candidates and Constraint Systems.

### Context dependency

Calls resolution modes might be separated into two kinds:

- Independent (potentially with an expected type): regular top-level statements, receivers, assignments RHS, etc.
- Dependent: arguments of other calls or return expressions of lambdas

```kotlin

fun main() {
    listOf("") // Independent
    val x: List<Any> = listOf("") // Independent with expected type

    listOf( // Independent
        listOf("") // Dependent
    )

    listOf( // Independent
        run { // Dependent
            listOf("") // Independent
            listOf("") // Dependent
        }
    )

    listOf( // Independent
        ""
    ).get(0) // Independent
}
```

**NB:** The calls that are used as receivers are being completed as `Independent` and it's crucial because our inference algorithm
doesn't allow type-constraints to flow back from the call to its receiver (like `mutableMapOf().put("", "")` is red code).

See `org.jetbrains.kotlin.fir.resolve.ResolutionMode`.

One of the most important use cases for the resolution mode is defining whether a call should be **fully** [completed](#completion-mode).

### Constraint System Creation

At the first step of any candidate call resolution, we create a constraint system ([CS](#cs--constraint-system)), which has:

- A specific dedicated type variable ([TV](#tv--type-variable-fresh-type-variable)) for each type parameter in the call-tree.
- A set of constraints for each type variable in a form of `Tv <: SomeType` (UPPER), `SomeType <: Tv` (LOWER)
  or `Tv := SomeType` (EQUALITY).
- Basic constraints, obtained from the relevant type parameters upper bounds, e.g. `Tv <: Closeable` for
  `fun <T : Closeable> T.use(...)`.

**NB**: in the case of complex call-trees (`parentCall(argumentCall())`) the parent calls accumulate CS of all the arguments and add
their own type variables.

**NB**: CS is being created for each candidate, even for ones that later might be declared as inapplicable.
Even the candidates with no type parameters should have their CS (the empty one).

See `org.jetbrains.kotlin.fir.resolve.calls.stages.CreateFreshTypeVariableSubstitutorStage`.

The substitutor from type parameter types to fresh type variables is stored at `Candidate::substitutor`.

### Candidate Resolution Phase

For each candidate we perform a bunch of resolution stages (see `org.jetbrains.kotlin.fir.resolve.calls.candidate.CallKind`), each of them
either works with its CS by introducing new [initial constraints](#initial-constraints),
or in some other ways checks if the candidate is applicable.

The most illustrative example of the resolution stage is `CheckArguments` which effectively adds argument-related initial constraints
in the form of `ValueArgumentType <: ValueParameterType`.

**NB:** During candidate resolution it's not allowed to go into lambda analysis because the signature of the anonymous function might
depend on the candidate and there may be more than one candidate.
And resolution of the same lambda body more than once would make the whole call resolution algorithm exponential.

After that, if the Constraint System contains contradiction, we discard the candidate and go to the next one
(or report an error for the last one).

Otherwise, if we've got a single perfect candidate, we choose it and go to the *Completion Stage*.

### Initial Constraints

*Initial constraint* is an arbitrary type restriction obtained from code semantics.

The most basic example of such a constraint is that a value argument type must be a subtype of a parameter type.
Or it might be an expected type in case like `val x: List<String> = listOf()` (initial constraint would be `List<Tv> <: List<String>`).

Without losing generality, we might say that all the initial constraints have the form of `ArbitraryType1 <: ArbitraryType2`.

And their main purpose is deriving *type variable constraints* (`Tv <: SomeType`, `SomeType <: Tv`, or `Tv := SomeType`).

### Deriving Constraints

The process of deriving constraints works through the regular subtyping algorithm with a special callback catching attempt to check
if some type is a subtype of a type variable or vice versa.

```kotlin

fun <T> foo(x: Collection<T>) {}

fun bar(x: MutableList<String>) {
    foo(x)
}
```

For example, in the case above:

- We add an initial constraint `MutableList<String> <: Collection<Tv>`
- When checking, the subtyping algorithm looks for a matching type with a matching type constructor for subtyping, i.e.,`Collection<String>`
- Thus, the subtyping check is reduced to `Collection<String> <: Collection<Tv>`.
- For such cases, we check each type argument and as we've got the single covariant parameter
- Thus, we deduce that `String <: Tv` and got a new lower constraint on `Tv`.

For more details, see `org.jetbrains.kotlin.types.AbstractTypeChecker.isSubtypeOf` and
`org.jetbrains.kotlin.resolve.calls.inference.components.TypeCheckerStateForConstraintSystem.addSubtypeConstraint` as an example of the
overridden callback for catching a type variable comparison case.

One of the potential results of the subtyping algorithm might be a failure
if some intermediate constraint `ArbitraryType1 <: ArbitraryType2` cannot be satisfied.

For example, `MutableMap<String, Int> <: Map<Tv, String>` would be derived to `Int <: String` constraint
which cannot be satisfied.

In this situation, we say that CS has a *contradiction*.

### Constraint Incorporation

Once there's a new *type variable constraint*, it might make sense to derive new ones from it using constraints derived in previous steps
and relying on subtyping transitivity.

If a new *incorporated variable constraint* has been added, we repeat the process recursively.

There are two kinds of incorporation.

#### Direct With The Same Variable

If the new constraint has a form of `Tv <: SomeType`, for each existing lower (opposite) constraint `OtherType <: Tv`, we may add
a new *initial constraint* `OtherType <: SomeType`.

```kotlin
fun <I> id(x: I): I = x

fun <T> listOf(): List<T> = TODO()

fun main() {
    val x: List<String> = id(listOf())
}
```

In the above example we would have:

- Initial constraint `List<Tv> <: Iv` (which immediately adds a lower constraint on `Iv`)
- `Iv <: List<String>` from expected type (which immediately adds an upper constraint on `Iv`)
- Thus, from the transitive closure of `List<Tv> <: Iv` and `Iv <: List<String>` we might deduce
  a new initial constraint `List<Tv> <: List<String>`
- From which we finally may derive an upper constraint `Tv <: String`

#### Inside Other Constraints

If the new constraint has a form of `Tv <: SomeType`, for each other type variable `Fv` which contains `Tv` inside its constraints,
for each such constraint `Fv <: OtherType<..Tv..>`, we make a tricky substitution of `Tv` inside `OtherType<..>` with some approximation of
`SomeType` which would give a new **correct** initial constraint.

- In a simple case of `Fv <: Tv`, we would add `Fv <: SomeType`.
- In more complex `Fv <: Inv<Tv>`, it would be `Fv <: Inv<out SomeType>`.

For more details, see `org.jetbrains.kotlin.resolve.calls.inference.components.ConstraintIncorporator.insideOtherConstraint`

### Completion Stage

At this stage, we've got:

- Chosen candidates for the call and for all its call-sub-arguments
- Single Constraint System which contains type variables from the whole call-tree with their constraints and no-yet found contradictions
- No lambda has been analyzed yet
- For `Independent` calls, there might be an expected type (which initially should be contributed into a relevant initial constraint)

**Completion** is a process that for given information tries to infer the resulting type for each type variable and to analyze all the given
lambdas.

#### Completion Mode

Completion mode (`ConstraintSystemCompletionMode`) defines how actively/forcefully the given call is being completed

* `PARTIAL` — used for calls that are other calls arguments
    * It prevents from fixing TV that are related somehow to return types because their actual result depends on the chosen outer call
    * Otherwise, it tries to infer as much as possible, but doesn’t lead to reporting not-inferred-type-parameter or running PCLA lambdas
    * On one hand, we might’ve not run that kind of completion at all, and just accumulate nested argument calls into an outer as is,
    * but inferring something allows disambiguating outer candidates
    * ```
      val x: Int = 1
      fun main() {
          x.plus(run { x })
      }
      ```
* `FULL` — used for top statement-level calls and receivers
    * It tries to fix/analyze everything we have
    * And start PCLA analysis if necessary
    * Reports errors if for some TV there’s no enough information to infer them
* `UNTIL_FIRST_LAMBDA` — used for OverloadByLambdaReturnType
    * Similar to FULL, but stops after first lambda analyzed
* `PCLA_POSTPONED_CALL` — see [pcla.md](pcla.md).

#### Completion Framework

Roughly, the framework algorithm might be represented in the form of the following pseudocode, some parts of which will be described
in the following sections

```kotlin
while (true) {
    if (analyzeSomeLambdaWithProperInputTypes()) continue

    if (findAndFixReadyTypeVariable()) continue

    if (completionMode == FULL) if (analyzeSomeLambdaWithPCLA()) continue

    if (completionMode == FULL) reportNotInferredTypeVariable()
}
```

After the loop is completed in `FULL` mode, the completion results are being applied to the FIR call representations via
`FirCallCompletionResultsWriterTransformer`.

For more details see `FirCallCompleter` and `org.jetbrains.kotlin.fir.resolve.inference.ConstraintSystemCompleter.runCompletion` for the
actual representation of the Main While Loop.

**NB:** From the definition of the loop, it shouldn't be very hard to show that it converges in polynomial time
(if all the operations are polynomial).

### Basic Lambda analysis

If for some lambda all its [input types](#input-types-of-a-lambda) are proper, it's possible to start its regular analysis.

All its statements beside return ones (including the last expression) might be resolved as usual/independently.

If the return type of the lambda is [proper](#proper-typeconstraint), all return expressions (the subjects of return statements) should
be analyzed and completed independently (with return type as an ExpectedType).

Otherwise, they are being analyzed in `Dependent` mode and for each of them:

- It becomes a part of a root call-tree.
  For example, if we've got `return@lambda listOf()`, the type argument for the call should be inferred via the root completion phase
- We add another initial constraint `ReturnedExpressionType <: LambdaReturnType`.

### Inference Heuristics

With given CS data input and the given framework, there might be more than one "consistent" result.

For example, for the top-level [independent](#context-dependency) call `listOf("")` might-be inferred as `listOf<Any>("")` in a sense
that this result doesn't lead to any type contradiction, but that might surprise a user who
has a property `val myList = listOf("")` which type would be implicitly inferred to `List<Any>`.

The [Completion Framework](#completion-framework) defines a number of degrees of freedom which might be tuned to give different results.

And the following sections describe them and the state chosen for them in the attempt to have the most reasonable results.

**NB:** Those degrees of freedom do not just define the resulting type arguments but potentially affect if the inference process converges
successfully.
For example, too early type variable fixation (e.g., before analysis of a lambda with a return type containing the variable) might lead
to contradictions which wouldn't be there if we analyzed the lambda beforehand.

### Variable Selection

During the completion some of the type variables become *fixed*, i.e., the final type for
them is chosen, and all occurrences of the variable inside other constraints are replaced with that type.
Also, this type is used as a type argument when completion ends.

Thus, such a fixed type variable stops being an active part of the Constraint System.

#### Variables that cannot be fixed

Some of the variables that are not yet fixed might be forbidden to fix at this point.

The most obvious reason is the lack of any [proper constraint](#proper-constraint), thus there's not just enough information yet to choose
the type.

Another reason might be relevant for [dependent](#context-dependency) calls: a type variable is forbidden to fix if it is related to
the return type of the call.
The explanation for this rule is that this particular call is an argument of another call for which we don't know yet what candidate would
be chosen.
Thus don't know a proper expected type that might in fact contradict the chosen result type.

```kotlin
fun foo(x: MutableList<Any>, y: Int) {}
fun foo(x: MutableList<String>, y: String) {}

fun main() {
    // Resolved to the first overload
    foo(
        // String <: Tv
        // Potentially, we might've fixed Tv to String when resolving `mutableListOf("")`.
        // But that would lead to `MutableList<String> <: MutableList<Int>` contradiction
        mutableListOf(""),
        1
    )
}
```

#### Variables order

All other variables (that might be fixed) are being sorted according to a set of heuristics, and then the first one is chosen to be fixed.

**NB:** if two variables are equal from heuristics' point-of-view, the one that has a shorter path in a call-tree is chosen
(see `org.jetbrains.kotlin.fir.resolve.inference.ConstraintSystemCompleter.getOrderedAllTypeVariables` for details).

When it comes to heuristics, we consider the following factors:

- if a variable is contained in an input type of lambda (see
  `PostponedArgumentInputTypesResolver.fixNextReadyVariableForParameterTypeIfNeeded`)
- If a variable has dependency (constraints) related to another not-fixed variable
- If a variable is used in any output types (return types of lambdas)
- Or even if it's made upon a reified type parameter

But for the exact ordering, it's better to look at the freshest version of `VariableFixationFinder.getTypeVariableReadiness` as it made
in a quite descriptive form.

### Result Type For Fixation

Once the variable is chosen, we should decide to which result type it should be fixed.

**Input:**

- Non-contradictory state of Constraint System
- The list of constraints for the type variable (at least one of them must be proper)
- Constraints of other type variables that potentially might be related

At first, we look if there are some `EQUAL` constraints and choose first of them which doesn't contain integer literal types
(**NB:** anyway all of them should not contradict each other, so in some broad sense all such constraints are equal).

Otherwise, we choose a representative **subtype** and **supertype** if applicable.

For **subtype**, we select all the lower constraints and compute a *common supertype of them*.
A common supertype is expected to be the lowest upper bound on the type lattice, i.e., it should be a supertype
of all the lower constraints, but it should be as "precise" as possible (see `NewCommonSuperTypeCalculator`).

In case of non-proper lower constraints, we replace type variables in them with special *stub types* which behave like they're equal to
anything.

For example, here:

```kotlin
fun <F> select(f1: F, f2: F): F = TODO()

fun main() {
    select(
        // MutableList<String> <: Fv
        mutableListOf<String>(),
        // List<Tv> <: Fv
        emptyList()
    )
}
```

We don't yet have simple constraints for fixing `Tv`, so going to fix `Fv` first:

- It has two lower constraints: `List<Tv>` (`List<StubType>` after stub-type substitution) and `MutableList<String>`.
- Their common supertype is computed to `List<String>` (with the help of specially defined equality on stub-types).
- Thus, we fix `Fv := List<String>` and then `Tv := String`.

We don't cover that part extensively here, but it's guaranteed that the resulting type would not contain nor a type variable or a stub type.

For more details, look into `ResultTypeResolver.findSubType`

For **supertypes**, it's just an intersection of all *proper* types.

After that, *Captured Type Approximation* is applied to both of the candidate types
(if the approximated version does not lead to contradictions).

And in most cases if both candidate types exist, we choose the subtype (if it's not `Nothing?`), or return the single candidate type
(see `ResultTypeResolver.resultType` for details).

### Partially Constrained Lambda Analysis

For `FULL` completion mode, we've got the situation when no more type information might be brought from somewhere outside, so we have
to use only what we already got.

And if there are still some not-yet-fixed type variables _and_ some lambdas not-yet-analyzed
(because they contain type variables among their input types), the last resort would be to try analyzing them in some limited form.

The problem with that is that usually we don't allow using type variables inside the independent statements, while here we had to do that.

The most common example when it becomes necessary is builder functions with signature like
`fun <E> buildList(builderAction: MutableList<E>.() -> Unit): List<E>`, so in the case of independent call
like `buildList { add("") }` the only possible way to infer the type argument is to analyze lambda, but the lambda input type contains
the single type variable.

For more information, see [pcla.md](pcla.md).

## Glossary

### TV = type variable (fresh type variable)

Type variable is a special kind of type/type constructor being created for each type parameter in the call-tree.

To avoid confusion with type parameter types, we mostly use `Tv` for referencing type variable based on a type parameter named `T`.

Note that in the same call-tree, the same type parameter might be met twice (`listOf(listOf(""))`), but we would have two different
type variables (for sake of simplicity, let's call them `Tv1` and `Tv2`) for each instance of the call.

Another kind of type variables is synthetic ones created for lambdas unknown parameter/return types.

### CS = Constraint system

- Mostly, it’s just a collection of TVs and the constraints for them in a form of `Xi <: SomeType` or `SomeType <: Xi` or `Xi = SomeType`
- Represented as an instance of `org.jetbrains.kotlin.resolve.calls.inference.model.NewConstraintSystemImpl`

### Related TVs

See `TypeVariableDependencyInformationProvider` for details.

#### Shallow relation

Two variables `Xv` and `Yv` are shallowly related if there is some chain of a constraints
`Xv ~ a_1 ~ .. ~ a_n ~ Yv` where (`~` is either `<:` or `>:`)

#### Deep relation

Two variables `Xv` and `Yv` are deeply related if there is some chain of a constraints
`a_1 ~ .. ~ a_n` where (`~` is either `<:` or `>:`) **and** `a_1` contains `Xv` while `a_n` contains `Yv`.

### Call-tree

A tree of calls, in which constraint systems are joined and solved(completed) together

### Proper type/constraint

A type/constraint that doesn't reference any (not-yet-fixed) type variables

### Input types of a lambda

- Receiver type
- Value parameter types

### Inference session

A set of callbacks related to inference that being called during function body transformations.
