The presence of this file enables the "tools_jar_profile" profile in kotlin-annotation-processing,
    which adds "tools.jar" to the compile dependencies.

When Gradle loads this artifact, the "tools_jar_profile" profile should not be activated
    (cause it adds an extra dependency from the path based on the environment variable).

It wouldn't in fact because:
1. This file is normally absent when Gradle build with kapt is launched;
2. Gradle poorly supports Maven profiles.
