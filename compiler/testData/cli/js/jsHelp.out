  -ir-output-name            Base name of generated files.
  -no-stdlib                 This option does nothing and is left for compatibility with the legacy backend.
                             It is deprecated and will be removed in Kotlin 2.2.
  -libraries <path>          Paths to Kotlin libraries with .meta.js and .kjsm files, separated by the system path separator.
  -source-map                Generate a source map.
  -source-map-prefix         Add the specified prefix to the paths in the source map.
  -source-map-base-dirs <path> Base directories for calculating relative paths to source files in the source map.
  -source-map-embed-sources {always|never|inlining}
                             Embed source files into the source map.
  -source-map-names-policy {no|simple-names|fully-qualified-names}
                             Mode for mapping generated names to original names.
  -meta-info                 This option does nothing and is left for compatibility with the legacy backend.
                             It is deprecated and will be removed in Kotlin 2.2.
  -target { es5, es2015 }    Generate JS files for the specified ECMA version.
  -module-kind {plain|amd|commonjs|umd|es}
                             The kind of JS module generated by the compiler. ES modules are enabled by default in case of ES2015 target usage
  -main {call|noCall}        Specify whether the 'main' function should be called upon execution.
  -language-version <version> Provide source compatibility with the specified version of Kotlin.
  -api-version <version>     Allow using declarations from only the specified version of bundled libraries.
  -kotlin-home <path>        Path to the Kotlin compiler home directory used for the discovery of runtime libraries.

                             In this mode, deprecations and bug fixes for unstable code take effect immediately
                             instead of going through a graceful migration cycle.
                             Code written in progressive mode is backward compatible; however, code written without
                             progressive mode enabled may cause compilation errors in progressive mode.
  -script                    Evaluate the given Kotlin script (*.kts) file.
  -opt-in <fq.name>          Enable API usages that require opt-in with an opt-in requirement marker with the given fully qualified name.
