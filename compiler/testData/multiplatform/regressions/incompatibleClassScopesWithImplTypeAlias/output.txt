    protected constructor Writer()

    The following declaration is incompatible because visibility is different:
        protected/*protected and package*/ constructor Writer()
    The following declaration is incompatible because number of value parameters is different:
        protected/*protected and package*/ constructor Writer(p0: Any!)

actual typealias Writer = java.io.Writer
