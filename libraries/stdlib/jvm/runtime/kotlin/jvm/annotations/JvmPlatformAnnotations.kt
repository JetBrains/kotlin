/**
 * This annotation marks Kotlin `expect` declarations that are implicitly actualized by Java.
 *
 * # Safety Risks
 *
 * Implicit actualization bypasses safety features, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior. If you use this annotation, some
 * of the expect-actual invariants are not checked.
 *
 * Use this annotation only as a last resort. The annotation might stop working in future Kotlin versions without prior notice.
 *
 * If you use this annotation, consider describing your use cases in [KT-58545](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-58545) comments.
 *
 * # Migration
 *
 * Alternatives:
 * 1. Rewrite the code using explicit `actual typealias`. Unfortunately, it requires you to move your expect declarations into another package.
 *    Refer to [KT-58545](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-58545) for a more detailed migration example.
 * 2. Use `kotlin.jvm.KotlinActual` experimental feature. See https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-67202
