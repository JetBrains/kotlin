/**
 * [KaModule] is the Analysis API's view on a module inside a project. A [KaModule] represents a [source set][KaSourceModule] (with
 * production and test sources being separate modules), [script][KaScriptModule], [library][KaLibraryModule], and various niche concepts
 * such as [dangling files][KaDanglingFileModule].
 *
 * As an Analysis API user, you will mainly interact with [KaModule]s indirectly when providing a use-site module to an
 * [analyze][org.jetbrains.kotlin.analysis.api.analyze] call (usually derived from the use-site [KtElement][org.jetbrains.kotlin.psi.KtElement]
 * instead). However, it is possible to utilize the Analysis API's module support to explore the project structure and retrieve information
 * about individual modules when needed.
 *
 * Modules are crucial to establish the use-site view of [analysis sessions][org.jetbrains.kotlin.analysis.api.KaSession]. An analysis
 * session always exists in the context of a particular use-site module. The module determines the session's [resolution scope][org.jetbrains.kotlin.analysis.api.components.KaAnalysisScopeProvider.analysisScope],
 * and generally the content and dependencies from which [symbols][org.jetbrains.kotlin.analysis.api.symbols.KaSymbol] are resolved.
 *
 * Individual [KaModule]s for specific [PsiElements][com.intellij.psi.PsiElement] can be retrieved from [KaModuleProvider]. The
 * implementation of this provider, and the project structure in general, are provided by the [Analysis API platform](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/tree/master/analysis/analysis-api-platform-interface),
 * such as IntelliJ or Standalone. As such, [KaModule] implementations are not provided by the Analysis API engine (in contrast to most of
 * the Analysis API surface), but rather by individual platforms.
 *
 * Modules are also the Analysis API's unit of modification. When a code change has possible non-local consequences (i.e. it happens outside
 * an isolated function or property body), the resulting cache invalidation occurs on the level of a module and its dependents. While
 * modification handling overall is an Analysis API *platform* topic, it is important to establish this basic fact.
