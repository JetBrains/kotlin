/*
To regenerate this test:
  1. Change JvmAbi.VERSION to -1
  2. Run 'ant dist'
  3. Rename this file and wrong-package: delete 'txt' extension
  4. Compile two files with the newly built compiler from dist/
  5. Rename files back: add 'txt' extension
  6. Change JvmAbi.VERSION back to its old value
  7. Run 'ant dist'
After these steps, the test should succeed
