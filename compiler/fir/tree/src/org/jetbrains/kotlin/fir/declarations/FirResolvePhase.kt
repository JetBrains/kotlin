/**
 * Compilation in the FIR compiler is performed in separate compiler phases.
 *
 * ### Modes
 *
 * There are two compiler modes:
 *
 * - The CLI compiler mode (aka full resolution mode): the compiler executes all phases sequentially for all declarations.
 *   This means that the processor for phase `A` will transform all declarations in the first round.
 *   In the next round, the processor for phase `B` (which follows `A`) will transform all declarations.
 *   This mode can be expressed by pseudocode like:
 *   ```kotlin
 *    for (phase in allFirResolvePhases) {
 *      for (file in allFirFiles) {
 *        runPhaseOnFile(file, phase)
 *      }
 *    }
 *    ```
 *
 * - The Analysis API mode (aka lazy resolution mode):
 *   the compiler executes the requested phase [lazily][org.jetbrains.kotlin.fir.symbols.lazyResolveToPhase]
 *   (on demand) for some particular declaration (not for all declarations in contrast to the CLI mode).
 *   This mode can be expressed by pseudocode like:
 *   ```kotlin
 *    for (phase in allFirResolvePhases) {
 *      runPhaseOnDeclaration(declaration, phase)
 *    }
 *    ```
 *
 * ### Contracts
 *
 * There are a few contracts for both modes:
 *
 * 1. All phases **must be executed only in a sequential manner**.
 *   For example, if the compiler wants to resolve some declaration to the phase [COMPILER_REQUIRED_ANNOTATIONS],
 *   then it has to resolve it to all previous phases first: to the [RAW_FIR] phase,
 *   then to the [IMPORTS] phase, and only afterward can the compiler execute the phase [COMPILER_REQUIRED_ANNOTATIONS].
 *
 * 2. The compiler **must not request and cannot rely on any information from the higher phases**.
 *   For example, during the [STATUS] phase, we cannot access information regarding implicit types
 *   as they will only be calculated during the [IMPLICIT_TYPES_BODY_RESOLVE] phase.
 *   See [isItAllowedToCallLazyResolveTo] as a reference.
 *
 * 3. The compiler **can request and rely on the information from the current phase only during *jumping phases***.
 *   For example, during the [TYPES] phase,
 *   we cannot request type information for other declarations (except information from the [SUPER_TYPES] phase, such as a super type)
 *   as this information will be calculated only during this phase.
 *
 * ### Jumping phases
 *
 * A *jumping phase* is a phase that can request the phase-specific information during that same phase from another declaration.
 *
 * Currently, we have four ***jumping phases***:
 *
 * - [COMPILER_REQUIRED_ANNOTATIONS] – The compiler can jump from the use site of an annotation to the annotation class
 *   and resolve its annotations as well.
 * - [SUPER_TYPES] – The compiler resolves super types (expands typealiases in them) recursively for all classes from
 *   the bottom class to the top one.
 * - [STATUS] – The compiler resolves the status for super declarations first.
 * - [IMPLICIT_TYPES_BODY_RESOLVE] – The compiler can jump from one declaration to another during this phase as one
 *   declaration with an implicit type can depend on the implicit type of another declaration,
 *   and the compiler needs to calculate the type for it first.
