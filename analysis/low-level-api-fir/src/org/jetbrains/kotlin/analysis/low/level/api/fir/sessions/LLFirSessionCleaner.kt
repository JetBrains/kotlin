 * It must not keep a strong reference to its associated [LLFirSession], because otherwise the weak reference-based garbage collection of
 * unused sessions will not work.
 *
 * @param disposable The associated [LLFirSession]'s [disposable]. Keeping a separate reference ensures that the disposable can be disposed
 *  even after the session has been reclaimed by the GC.
