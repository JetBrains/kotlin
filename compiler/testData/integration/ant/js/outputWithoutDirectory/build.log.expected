     [java] warning: ==========
     [java] This project currently uses the Kotlin/JS Legacy compiler backend, which has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
     [java]
     [java] Please migrate your project to the new IR-based compiler (https://kotl.in/jsir).
     [java] Because your build tool will not support the new Kotlin/JS compiler, you will also need to migrate to Gradle.
     [java]
     [java] You can continue to use the deprecated legacy compiler in the current version of the toolchain by providing the compiler option -Xuse-deprecated-legacy-compiler.
