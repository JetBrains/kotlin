/* If this file is compiled with threads support, it must
       #define __GTHREADS 1
   to indicate that threads support is present.  Also it has define
   function
     int __gthread_active_p ()
   that returns 1 if thread system is active, 0 if not.

   The threads interface must define the following types:
     __gthread_key_t
     __gthread_once_t
     __gthread_mutex_t
     __gthread_recursive_mutex_t

   The threads interface must define the following macros:

     __GTHREAD_ONCE_INIT
     		to initialize __gthread_once_t
     __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT
     		to initialize __gthread_mutex_t to get a fast
		non-recursive mutex.
     __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION
		to initialize __gthread_mutex_t to get a fast
		non-recursive mutex.
		Define this to a function which looks like this:
		  void __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION (__gthread_mutex_t *)
     		Some systems can't initialize a mutex without a
		function call.  Don't define __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT in this case.
     __GTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INIT
     __GTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION
     		as above, but for a recursive mutex.

   The threads interface must define the following static functions:

     int __gthread_once (__gthread_once_t *once, void (*func) ())

     int __gthread_key_create (__gthread_key_t *keyp, void (*dtor) (void *))
     int __gthread_key_delete (__gthread_key_t key)

     void *__gthread_getspecific (__gthread_key_t key)
     int __gthread_setspecific (__gthread_key_t key, const void *ptr)

     int __gthread_mutex_destroy (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_destroy (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

     int __gthread_mutex_lock (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_mutex_trylock (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_mutex_unlock (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);

     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_lock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_trylock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_unlock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

   The following are supported in POSIX threads only. They are required to
   fix a deadlock in static initialization inside libsupc++. The header file
   gthr-posix.h defines a symbol __GTHREAD_HAS_COND to signify that these extra
   features are supported.

   Types:
     __gthread_cond_t

   Macros:
     __GTHREAD_COND_INIT
     __GTHREAD_COND_INIT_FUNCTION

   Interface:
     int __gthread_cond_broadcast (__gthread_cond_t *cond);
     int __gthread_cond_wait (__gthread_cond_t *cond, __gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_cond_wait_recursive (__gthread_cond_t *cond,
					__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

   All functions returning int should return zero on success or the error
   number.  If the operation is not supported, -1 is returned.

   If the following are also defined, you should
     #define __GTHREADS_CXX0X 1
   to enable the c++0x thread library.

   Types:
     __gthread_t
     __gthread_time_t

   Interface:
     int __gthread_create (__gthread_t *thread, void *(*func) (void*),
                           void *args);
     int __gthread_join (__gthread_t thread, void **value_ptr);
     int __gthread_detach (__gthread_t thread);
     int __gthread_equal (__gthread_t t1, __gthread_t t2);
     __gthread_t __gthread_self (void);
     int __gthread_yield (void);

     int __gthread_mutex_timedlock (__gthread_mutex_t *m,
                                    const __gthread_time_t *abs_timeout);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_timedlock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *m,
                                          const __gthread_time_t *abs_time);

     int __gthread_cond_signal (__gthread_cond_t *cond);
     int __gthread_cond_timedwait (__gthread_cond_t *cond,
                                   __gthread_mutex_t *mutex,
                                   const __gthread_time_t *abs_timeout);
