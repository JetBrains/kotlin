/**
 * Returns human-readable description, mapping multiplatform to 'Common (experimental)',
 * as well as maintaining some quirks of the previous representation, like trailing whitespaces
 *
 * It is needed mainly for backwards compatibility, because some subsystem actually
 * managed to rely on the format of that string. In particular, 'facetSerialization.kt' uses
 * those string as keys in serialized `.iml`-file, and changing format of that string (including
 * trimming pointless whitespaces) leads to incorrectly deserialized facets.
 *
 * New clients are encouraged to use [presentableDescription] description instead, as it
 * also provides better description for multiplatforms.
