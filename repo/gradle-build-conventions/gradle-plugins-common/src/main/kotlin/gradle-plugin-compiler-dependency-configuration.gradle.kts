/**
 * This precompiled script plugin is intended to be a temporary solution for KT-70247.
 * It should be removed after a proper resolution is provided.
 * Also, update the mention of this plugin from `gradle.properties`
 *
 * This plugin limits AV/LV for modules embedded into KGP, so it's safe to use a version compatible with bootstrap for Gradle-related modules.
 * KGP during embedding of these dependencies cuts off the Kotlin metadata as it's only required at compilation time and we do not expose those modules publicly.
