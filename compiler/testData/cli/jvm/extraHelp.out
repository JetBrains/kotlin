Usage: kotlinc-jvm <options> <source files>
where advanced options include:
  -Xabi-stability={stable|unstable}
                             When using unstable compiler features such as FIR, use 'stable' to mark generated class files as stable
                             to prevent diagnostics from stable compilers at the call site.
                             When using the JVM IR backend, conversely, use 'unstable' to mark generated class files as unstable
                             to force diagnostics to be reported.
  -Xadd-modules=<module[,]>  Root modules to resolve in addition to the initial modules,
                             or all modules on the module path if <module> is ALL-MODULE-PATH

                             -Xassertions=legacy:         calculate condition on each call, check depends on jvm assertion settings in the kotlin package;
                             default: legacy

                             Supported versions depend on the used JDK; for JDK 17+ supported versions are 1.8, 9, 10, ..., 17.
                             Also sets `-jvm-target` value equal to the selected JDK version
  -Xjspecify-annotations=ignore|strict|warn
                             Specify behavior for jspecify annotations.
                             Default value is 'warn'
  -Xjsr305={ignore/strict/warn}|under-migration:{ignore/strict/warn}|@<fq.name>:{ignore/strict/warn}
                             Specify behavior for JSR-305 nullability annotations:
                             -Xjsr305={ignore/strict/warn}                   globally (all non-@UnderMigration annotations)
                             -Xjsr305=under-migration:{ignore/strict/warn}   all @UnderMigration annotations

                             Modes:
                               * ignore
                               * strict (experimental; treat as other supported nullability annotations)
                               * warn (report a warning)
  -Xjvm-default={all|all-compatibility|disable|enable|compatibility}
                             Emit JVM default methods for interface declarations with bodies. Default is 'disable'.
                             -Xjvm-default=all                Generate JVM default methods for all interface declarations with bodies in the module.
                                                              Do not generate DefaultImpls stubs for interface declarations with bodies, which are generated by default
                                                              in the 'disable' mode. If interface inherits a method with body from an interface compiled in the 'disable'
                                                              mode and doesn't override it, then a DefaultImpls stub will be generated for it.
                                                              BREAKS BINARY COMPATIBILITY if some client code relies on the presence of DefaultImpls classes.
                                                              Note that if interface delegation is used, all interface methods are delegated.
                                                              The only exception are methods annotated with the deprecated @JvmDefault annotation.
                             -Xjvm-default=all-compatibility  In addition to the 'all' mode, generate compatibility stubs in the DefaultImpls classes.
                                                              Compatibility stubs could be useful for library and runtime authors to keep backward binary compatibility
                                                              for existing clients compiled against previous library versions.
                                                              'all' and 'all-compatibility' modes are changing the library ABI surface that will be used by clients after
                                                              the recompilation of the library. In that sense, clients might be incompatible with previous library
                                                              versions. This usually means that proper library versioning is required, e.g. major version increase in SemVer.
                                                              In case of inheritance from a Kotlin interface compiled in 'all' or 'all-compatibility' modes, DefaultImpls
                                                              compatibility stubs will invoke the default method of the interface with standard JVM runtime resolution semantics.
                                                              Perform additional compatibility checks for classes inheriting generic interfaces where in some cases
                                                              additional implicit method with specialized signatures was generated in the 'disable' mode:
                                                              unlike in the 'disable' mode, the compiler will report an error if such method is not overridden explicitly
                                                              and the class is not annotated with @JvmDefaultWithoutCompatibility (see KT-39603 for more details).
                             -Xjvm-default=disable            Default behavior. Do not generate JVM default methods and prohibit @JvmDefault annotation usage.
                             -Xjvm-default=enable             Deprecated. Allow usages of @JvmDefault; only generate the default method for annotated method
                                                              in the interface (annotating an existing method can break binary compatibility).
                             -Xjvm-default=compatibility      Deprecated. Allow usages of @JvmDefault; generate a compatibility accessor
                                                              in the DefaultImpls class in addition to the default interface method.

                                                                 Lambda objects created using `LambdaMetafactory.metafactory` will have different `toString()`.
                             -Xlambdas=class                     Generate lambdas as explicit classes
  -Xlink-via-signatures      Link JVM IR symbols via signatures, instead of descriptors.

                             `profilerPath` is a path to libasyncProfiler.so; async-profiler.jar should be on the compiler classpath.
                             If it's not on the classpath, the compiler will attempt to load async-profiler.jar from the containing directory of profilerPath.
                             Example: -Xprofile=<PATH_TO_ASYNC_PROFILER>/async-profiler/build/libasyncProfiler.so:event=cpu,interval=1ms,threads,start,framebuf=50000000:<SNAPSHOT_DIR_PATH>

  -Xsanitize-parentheses     Transform '(' and ')' in method names to some other character sequence.
                             This mode can BREAK BINARY COMPATIBILITY and is only supposed to be used to workaround

                             default: `indy-with-constants` for JVM target 9 or greater, `inline` otherwise
