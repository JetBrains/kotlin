Step #1
Compiled java files:
Compiled kotlin files:
    module1/src/module1_a.kt
    module2/src/module2_b.kt
Compile errors:
    Cannot access 'A': it is 'internal' in 'a'
    Cannot access 'A': it is 'internal' in 'a'
    Cannot access 'ClassAnnotation': it is 'internal' in 'a'
    Cannot access 'ClassAnnotation': it is 'internal' in 'a'
    Cannot access 'FileAnnotation': it is 'internal' in 'a'
    Cannot access 'FileAnnotation': it is 'internal' in 'a'
    Cannot access 'a': it is 'internal' in 'a'
    Function effective visibility 'public' should be the same or less permissive than its parameter type effective visibility 'internal'
