  * @version V1.0.0
  * @date    30-September-2011
  * @brief   This file provides firmware functions to manage the following 
  *          functionalities of the Reset and clock control (RCC) peripheral:
  *           - Internal/external clocks, PLL, CSS and MCO configuration
  *           - System, AHB and APB busses clocks configuration
  *           - Peripheral clocks configuration
  *           - Interrupts and flags management

  *                               RCC specific features
  *          ===================================================================
  *    
  *          After reset the device is running from Internal High Speed oscillator 
  *          (HSI 16MHz) with Flash 0 wait state, Flash prefetch buffer, D-Cache 
  *          and I-Cache are disabled, and all peripherals are off except internal
  *          SRAM, Flash and JTAG.
  *           - There is no prescaler on High speed (AHB) and Low speed (APB) busses;
  *             all peripherals mapped on these busses are running at HSI speed.
  *       	  - The clock for all peripherals is switched off, except the SRAM and FLASH.
  *           - All GPIOs are in input floating state, except the JTAG pins which
  *             are assigned to be used for debug purpose.
  *        
  *          Once the device started from reset, the user application has to:        
  *           - Configure the clock source to be used to drive the System clock
  *             (if the application needs higher frequency/performance)
  *           - Configure the System clock frequency and Flash settings  
  *           - Configure the AHB and APB busses prescalers
  *           - Enable the clock for the peripheral(s) to be used
  *           - Configure the clock source(s) for peripherals which clocks are not
  *             derived from the System clock (I2S, RTC, ADC, USB OTG FS/SDIO/RNG)

      Internal/external clocks, PLL, CSS and MCO configuration functions
 ===============================================================================  

  This section provide functions allowing to configure the internal/external clocks,
  PLLs, CSS and MCO pins.
  
  1. HSI (high-speed internal), 16 MHz factory-trimmed RC used directly or through
     the PLL as System clock source.

  2. LSI (low-speed internal), 32 KHz low consumption RC used as IWDG and/or RTC
     clock source.

  3. HSE (high-speed external), 4 to 26 MHz crystal oscillator used directly or
     through the PLL as System clock source. Can be used also as RTC clock source.

  4. LSE (low-speed external), 32 KHz oscillator used as RTC clock source.   

  5. PLL (clocked by HSI or HSE), featuring two different output clocks:
      - The first output is used to generate the high speed system clock (up to 168 MHz)
      - The second output is used to generate the clock for the USB OTG FS (48 MHz),
        the random analog generator (<=48 MHz) and the SDIO (<= 48 MHz).

  6. PLLI2S (clocked by HSI or HSE), used to generate an accurate clock to achieve 
     high-quality audio performance on the I2S interface.
  
  7. CSS (Clock security system), once enable and if a HSE clock failure occurs 
     (HSE used directly or through PLL as System clock source), the System clock
     is automatically switched to HSI and an interrupt is generated if enabled. 
     The interrupt is linked to the Cortex-M4 NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt) 
     exception vector.   

  8. MCO1 (microcontroller clock output), used to output HSI, LSE, HSE or PLL
     clock (through a configurable prescaler) on PA8 pin.

  9. MCO2 (microcontroller clock output), used to output HSE, PLL, SYSCLK or PLLI2S
     clock (through a configurable prescaler) on PC9 pin.

 *
@verbatim   
 ===============================================================================
             System, AHB and APB busses clocks configuration functions
 ===============================================================================  

  This section provide functions allowing to configure the System, AHB, APB1 and 
  APB2 busses clocks.
  
  1. Several clock sources can be used to drive the System clock (SYSCLK): HSI,
     HSE and PLL.
     The AHB clock (HCLK) is derived from System clock through configurable prescaler
     and used to clock the CPU, memory and peripherals mapped on AHB bus (DMA, GPIO...).
     APB1 (PCLK1) and APB2 (PCLK2) clocks are derived from AHB clock through 
     configurable prescalers and used to clock the peripherals mapped on these busses.
     You can use "RCC_GetClocksFreq()" function to retrieve the frequencies of these clocks.  

@note All the peripheral clocks are derived from the System clock (SYSCLK) except:
       - I2S: the I2S clock can be derived either from a specific PLL (PLLI2S) or
          from an external clock mapped on the I2S_CKIN pin. 
          You have to use RCC_I2SCLKConfig() function to configure this clock. 
       - RTC: the RTC clock can be derived either from the LSI, LSE or HSE clock
          divided by 2 to 31. You have to use RCC_RTCCLKConfig() and RCC_RTCCLKCmd()
          functions to configure this clock. 
       - USB OTG FS, SDIO and RTC: USB OTG FS require a frequency equal to 48 MHz
          to work correctly, while the SDIO require a frequency equal or lower than
          to 48. This clock is derived of the main PLL through PLLQ divider.
       - IWDG clock which is always the LSI clock.
       
  2. The maximum frequency of the SYSCLK and HCLK is 168 MHz, PCLK2 82 MHz and PCLK1 42 MHz.
     Depending on the device voltage range, the maximum frequency should be 
     adapted accordingly:
 +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+     
 | Latency       |                HCLK clock frequency (MHz)                           |
 |               |---------------------------------------------------------------------|     
 |               | voltage range  | voltage range  | voltage range   | voltage range   |
 |               | 2.7 V - 3.6 V  | 2.4 V - 2.7 V  | 2.1 V - 2.4 V   | 1.8 V - 2.1 V   |

 |---------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|   
 |1WS(2CPU cycle)|30 < HCLK <= 60 |24 < HCLK <= 48 |18 < HCLK <= 36  |16 < HCLK <= 32  | 
 |---------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|   
 |2WS(3CPU cycle)|60 < HCLK <= 90 |48 < HCLK <= 72 |36 < HCLK <= 54  |32 < HCLK <= 48  |
 |---------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------| 
 |3WS(4CPU cycle)|90 < HCLK <= 120|72 < HCLK <= 96 |54 < HCLK <= 72  |48 < HCLK <= 64  |
 |---------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------| 
 |4WS(5CPU cycle)|120< HCLK <= 150|96 < HCLK <= 120|72 < HCLK <= 90  |64 < HCLK <= 80  |
 |---------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------| 
 |5WS(6CPU cycle)|120< HCLK <= 168|120< HCLK <= 144|90 < HCLK <= 108 |80 < HCLK <= 96  | 
 |---------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------| 
 |6WS(7CPU cycle)|      NA        |144< HCLK <= 168|108 < HCLK <= 120|96 < HCLK <= 112 | 
 |---------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------| 
 |7WS(8CPU cycle)|      NA        |      NA        |120 < HCLK <= 138|112 < HCLK <= 120| 
 +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+    
   @note When VOS bit (in PWR_CR register) is reset to '0’, the maximum value of HCLK is 144 MHz.
         You can use PWR_MainRegulatorModeConfig() function to set or reset this bit.

                   Peripheral clocks configuration functions
 ===============================================================================  

  This section provide functions allowing to configure the Peripheral clocks. 
  
  1. The RTC clock which is derived from the LSI, LSE or HSE clock divided by 2 to 31.
     
  2. After restart from Reset or wakeup from STANDBY, all peripherals are off
     except internal SRAM, Flash and JTAG. Before to start using a peripheral you
     have to enable its interface clock. You can do this using RCC_AHBPeriphClockCmd()
     , RCC_APB2PeriphClockCmd() and RCC_APB1PeriphClockCmd() functions.

  3. To reset the peripherals configuration (to the default state after device reset)
     you can use RCC_AHBPeriphResetCmd(), RCC_APB2PeriphResetCmd() and 
     RCC_APB1PeriphResetCmd() functions.
     
  4. To further reduce power consumption in SLEEP mode the peripheral clocks can
     be disabled prior to executing the WFI or WFE instructions. You can do this
     using RCC_AHBPeriphClockLPModeCmd(), RCC_APB2PeriphClockLPModeCmd() and
     RCC_APB1PeriphClockLPModeCmd() functions.

  *         access using PWR_BackupAccessCmd(ENABLE) function before to configure
  *         the RTC clock source (to be done once after reset).    
  * @note   Once the RTC clock is configured it can't be changed unless the  
  *         Backup domain is reset using RCC_BackupResetCmd() function, or by
  *         a Power On Reset (POR).
  *    
  * @param  RCC_RTCCLKSource: specifies the RTC clock source.
  *          This parameter can be one of the following values:
  *            @arg RCC_RTCCLKSource_LSE: LSE selected as RTC clock
  *            @arg RCC_RTCCLKSource_LSI: LSI selected as RTC clock
  *            @arg RCC_RTCCLKSource_HSE_Divx: HSE clock divided by x selected
  *                                            as RTC clock, where x:[2,31]
  *  
  * @note   If the LSE or LSI is used as RTC clock source, the RTC continues to
  *         work in STOP and STANDBY modes, and can be used as wakeup source.
  *         However, when the HSE clock is used as RTC clock source, the RTC
  *         cannot be used in STOP and STANDBY modes.    
  * @note   The maximum input clock frequency for RTC is 1MHz (when using HSE as
  *         RTC clock source).
