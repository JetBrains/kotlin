[MultipleSourceSetRootsInCompilation | WARNING] Kotlin Source Set 'myCustomCommonMain' is included in compilations of Kotlin Targets: 'jvm', 'linuxX64'
but it doesn't depend on 'commonMain'

Please remove 'myCustomCommonMain' and include its sources to one of the default source set: https://kotl.in/hierarchy-template
For example:

    kotlin.sourceSets.commonMain.kotlin.srcDir() // <-- pass here sources directory

Or add explicit dependency if the solution above is not applicable:

    kotlin.sourceSets["myCustomCommonMain"].dependsOn(commonMain)

See https://kotl.in/connecting-source-sets for more details.
