     * special value Visibilities.ALWAYS_SUITABLE_RECEIVER should be used.
     * If it's needed to determine whether visibility accepts any receiver, Visibilities.IRRELEVANT_RECEIVER should be used.

     * NB: Currently Visibilities.IRRELEVANT_RECEIVER has the same effect as 'null'

     * Also it's important that implementation that take receiver into account do aware about these special values.

     * it returns false for PROTECTED because protected members of classes can be imported to be used in subclasses of their containers,
     * so when we are looking at the import, we don't know whether it is legal somewhere in this file or not.
