 *
 * Session invalidation events are guaranteed to be published after the associated sessions have been invalidated.
 * Sessions can be invalidated either in a write action, or in the case if the caller can guarantee no other threads can perform
 * invalidation or code analysis until the cleanup is complete. Session invalidation events are published on the same thread â€“ it means
 * only the reporter thread has access to sessions.
 *
 * When a session is garbage-collected due to being softly reachable, no session invalidation event will be published for it. See the
 * documentation of [LLFirSession] for background information.

 * Session invalidation events are not published for unstable
 * [KtDanglingFileModules][org.jetbrains.kotlin.analysis.api.projectStructure.KaDanglingFileModule].
