w: [PlatformSourceSetConventionUsedWithCustomTargetName | WARNING] Source Set used with custom target name
Accessed 'source set jvmMain', but jvm target used a custom name 'customName' (expected 'jvm'):

Replace:
```
kotlin {
    jvm("customName") /* <- custom name used */
}
```

With:
```
kotlin {
    jvm()
}
```
Please use the jvm() target name.
