# Script to convert Space CODEOWNERS to matching GitHub CODEOWNERS
# 1. Copies CODEOWNERS file to .github
# 2. Replaces team owners such as "Kotlin Build Infrastructure" with their GitHub team equivalent for GitHub CODEOWNERS
# 3. If given Space team is in "codeowners-virtual-team-mapping.json", "virtualMembers" field is used instead of the GitHub team
