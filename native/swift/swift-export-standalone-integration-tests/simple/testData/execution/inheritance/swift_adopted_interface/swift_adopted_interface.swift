    // Regression for the implementation-marker fix: a Swift class subclasses an exported Kotlin
    // class (Base) whose Kotlin type does NOT implement Speaker, and separately conforms to the
    // Kotlin interface Speaker. Previously the witness extension was constrained on
    // _KotlinBridgeable (which every KotlinBase subclass satisfies), so Swift would silently supply
    // a delegating default that calls Speaker_speak on the Base backing — which doesn't implement
    // Speaker — yielding wrong dispatch / a crash. Now the witness is gated on the implementation
    // marker `__Speaker`, which Base does not carry, so the Swift class must implement the interface
    // itself, and Kotlin-side interface dispatch reaches those Swift implementations.

        func speak() -> String { "swift base speaks" }

    // Direct Swift dispatch
    #expect(s.speak() == "swift base speaks")
    #expect(s.volume() == 7)
    #expect(s.greet() == "Hello from Kotlin")

    // Kotlin-side interface dispatch lands in the Swift implementations
    #expect(callSpeak(s: s) == "swift base speaks")
    #expect(callVolume(s: s) == 7)
    #expect(callGreet(base: s) == "Hello from Kotlin")
