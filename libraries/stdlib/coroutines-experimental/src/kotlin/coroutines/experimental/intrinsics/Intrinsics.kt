/**
 * Obtains the current continuation instance inside suspend functions and either suspends
 * currently running coroutine or returns result immediately without suspension.
 *
 * If the [block] returns the special [COROUTINE_SUSPENDED] value, it means that suspend function did suspend the execution and will
 * not return any result immediately. In this case, the [Continuation] provided to the [block] shall be invoked at some moment in the
 * future when the result becomes available to resume the computation.
 *
 * Otherwise, the return value of the [block] must have a type assignable to [T] and represents the result of this suspend function.
 * It means that the execution was not suspended and the [Continuation] provided to the [block] shall not be invoked.
 * As the result type of the [block] is declared as `Any?` and cannot be correctly type-checked,
 * its proper return type remains on the conscience of the suspend function's author.
 *
 * Note that it is not recommended to call either [Continuation.resume] nor [Continuation.resumeWithException] functions synchronously
 * in the same stackframe where suspension function is run. Use [suspendCoroutine] as a safer way to obtain current
 * continuation instance.
