// JVM_DEFAULT_MODE: no-compatibility

// This test is checking that:
// 1) Test2 has both the specialized methods (with String in the signature) and the bridges (with Any) for both property accessors
// 2) Test2 does not have a DefaultImpls class
// 3) TestClass has neither the specialized methods, nor the bridges
