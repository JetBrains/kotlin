/**
 * Lists configurable feature toggles for Incremental Compilation.
 * Obsolete features might be removed, so it's not recommended
 * to use this outside of Kotlin repository.
 *
 * It's intended to be used across all build systems and target platforms.
 * Then, for example, if we're ready to port a feature from one platform to another,
 * we just have to initialize the build system-dependent property, and the value
 * would be available at the use site without any additional boilerplate.
 *
 * To add a new feature toggle, consider this checklist:
 *
 * 1. Gradle input: see [AbstractKotlinCompile.makeIncrementalCompilationFeatures].
 *    Platform-agnostic properties should be the default, but you can extend one of the subclasses, if needed.
 *    If new property might affect the result of compilation, annotate it with @Input.
 * 2. Gradle.properties support: declare the property in [org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.plugin.PropertiesProvider].
 *    Add its use in [org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.configuration.AbstractKotlinCompileConfig] or one of its subclasses (see step 1).
 * 3. Build Tools Api, KGP to Interface part: see [BuildToolsApiCompilationWork.performCompilation]
 *    You need to update both the interface [IncrementalJvmCompilationConfiguration] and its implementation(s).
 * 4. Build Tools Api, Interface to Implementation part: see [ICConfiguration.extractIncrementalCompilationFeatures] and its uses.
 *    Most likely you just need to update the `extract` method.
 * 5. Maven - TODO(emazhukin) will do and describe in KT-63837
 * 6. Gradle Integration Tests - add new option to [org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.testbase.BuildOptions]
