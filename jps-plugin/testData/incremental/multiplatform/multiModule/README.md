Multiplatform multi module tests.

This tests is autogenerated based on dependencies.txt by `MppJpsIncTestsGenerator`.

This things are generated:
  - For each module content will be generated based on module type:
     - `common`
     - `jvm`
     - `js`
  - Modules can be marked with `edit`, `editJvm` and `editExpectActual`. For this modules, modification steps will be generated. For each module and each flag subdirectory will be created and empty `build.log` will be putted (if it wasn't already). This directory will be used to generate `MultiplatformJpsTestGenerated`.
     - `edit`, `editJvm`:
        - new services will be created 
        - service will be changed
        - service will be deleted
     - `editExpectActual`
        - new services will be created in common module
        - service will be created on each platform module as separate step (to test common files state tracking separately for each platform module)
        - service will be changed on each platform module as separate step
        - service will be deleted

Module contents will be generated at run time in the temporary directory. To see it contents please set breakpoint at `TODO`. To simplify mega-multi-modules tests debugging, all modules are sorted in topological order and prefixed with index. Example of generated project:
```
00_raJvmClient_RaJvmClientJavaClass.java
00_raJvmClient_serviceRaJvmClientImpl.kt
01_raJvmServer_RaJvmServerJavaClass.java
01_raJvmServer_serviceRaJvmServerImpl.kt
02_raJsClient_serviceRaJsClientImpl.kt
03_raJsServer_serviceRaJsServerImpl.kt
04_rbJvmClient_RbJvmClientJavaClass.java
04_rbJvmClient_serviceRbJvmClientImpl.kt
