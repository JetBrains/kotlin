## kotlinx-metadata

This is the platform-agnostic part of the Kotlin Metadata library, intended to provide the possibility to read and modify metadata of Kotlin declarations in the binary (`.class`, `.js`) files emitted by the Kotlin compiler. This part of the library is currently not released on its own. Please refer to [kotlinx-metadata-jvm](jvm/ReadMe.md) for instructions on how to load and modify Kotlin Metadata in JVM binaries (`.class` and `.kotlin_module` files).
