/**
 * A plugin DSL extension for configuring Application Binary Interface (ABI) validation.
 *
 * ABI validation is a part of the Kotlin toolset designed to control which declarations are available to other modules.
 * Use this tool to control the binary compatibility of your library or shared module.
 *
 * This extension is available inside the `kotlin {}` block in your build script:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * kotlin {
 *     abiValidation {
 *         // Your ABI validation configuration
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 *  Note that this DSL is experimental, and it will likely change in future versions until it is stable.
 *
 * @since 2.2.0

 *
 * Each report variant has a unique name.
 *

 *
 * You can access tasks using properties:

 * For the main variant:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * kotlin {

 *         legacyDump.legacyDumpTaskProvider
 *         legacyDump.legacyCheckTaskProvider

 *
 *```kotlin
 * kotlin {
 *     abiValidation {
 *         variants.getByName("my").legacyDump.legacyDumpTaskProvider
 *         variants.getByName("my").legacyDump.legacyCheckTaskProvider
