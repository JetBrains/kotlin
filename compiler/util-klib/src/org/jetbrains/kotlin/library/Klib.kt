/**
 * [Klib] represents an instance of Kotlin library (Klib) that can be read by the compiler or any other tools.
 *
 * In the future, this interface is supposed to replace [KotlinLibrary].
 *
 * The [Klib] consists of multiple components, each responsible for a certain aspect of the library.
 * There are the following "mandatory" components that are always present:
 * - [KlibMetadataComponent], which provides read access to the metadata stored inside the library.
 * - TODO(KT-81411): add more
 *
 * The component can be obtained by calling [getComponent]. For some components there exist
 * extension properties to ease the access and provide a good DSL-like experience. For example:
 * ```
 * val klib: Klib = ...
 * val metadata: KlibMetadataComponent = klib.metadata // Shortcut for `klib.getComponent(KlibMetadataComponent.ID)`
 * ```
