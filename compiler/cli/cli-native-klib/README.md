This module contains parts of driver code responsible for compiling Kotlin source files to klibs, 
and does not depend on the Kotlin/Native compiler backend (`/kotlin-native/backend.native/compiler/ir/backend.native`)

Please note that it is not finished because it is missing the actual CLI interface (KT-81748).
