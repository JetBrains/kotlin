Usage: kotlinc-jvm <options> <source files>
where advanced options include:
  -Xabi-stability={stable|unstable}
                             When using unstable compiler features such as FIR, use 'stable' to mark generated class files as stable
                             to prevent diagnostics from being reported when using stable compilers at the call site.
                             When using the JVM IR backend, conversely, use 'unstable' to mark generated class files as unstable
                             to force diagnostics to be reported.
  -Xadd-modules=<module[,]>  Root modules to resolve in addition to the initial modules, or all modules on the module path if <module> is ALL-MODULE-PATH.
  -Xallow-no-source-files    Allow the set of source files to be empty.
  -Xallow-unstable-dependencies Do not report errors on classes in dependencies that were compiled by an unstable version of the Kotlin compiler.
  -Xassertions={always-enable|always-disable|jvm|legacy}
                             'kotlin.assert' call behavior:
                             -Xassertions=always-enable:  enable, ignore JVM assertion settings;
                             -Xassertions=always-disable: disable, ignore JVM assertion settings;
                             -Xassertions=jvm:            enable, depend on JVM assertion settings;
                             -Xassertions=legacy:         calculate the condition on each call, the behavior depends on JVM assertion settings in the kotlin package;
                             default: legacy
  -Xbackend-threads=<N>      When using the IR backend, run lowerings by file in N parallel threads.
                             0 means use one thread per processor core.
                             The default value is 1.
  -Xbuild-file=<path>        Path to the .xml build file to compile.
  -Xcompile-java             Reuse 'javac' analysis and compile Java source files.
  -Xdefault-script-extension=<script filename extension>
                             Compile expressions and unrecognized scripts passed with the -script argument as scripts with the given filename extension.
  -Xdisable-standard-script  Disable standard Kotlin scripting support.
  -Xir-do-not-clear-binding-context
                             When using the IR backend, do not clear BindingContext between 'psi2ir' and lowerings.
  -Xemit-jvm-type-annotations Emit JVM type annotations in bytecode.
  -Xdebug                    Enable debug mode for compilation.
                             Currently this includes spilling all variables in a suspending context regardless of whether they are alive.
  -Xir-inliner               Inline functions using the IR inliner instead of the bytecode inliner.
  -Xjvm-enable-preview       Allow using Java features that are in the preview phase.
                             This works like '--enable-preview' in Java. All class files are marked as compiled with preview features, meaning it won't be possible to use them in release environments.
  -Xenhance-type-parameter-types-to-def-not-null
                             Enhance not-null-annotated type parameter types to definitely-non-nullable types ('@NotNull T' => 'T & Any').
  -Xfriend-paths=<path>      Paths to output directories for friend modules (modules whose internals should be visible).
  -Xmultifile-parts-inherit  Compile multifile classes as a hierarchy of parts and a facade.
  -Xmodule-path=<path>       Paths to Java 9+ modules.
  -Xjava-package-prefix      Package prefix for Java files.
  -Xjava-source-roots=<path> Paths to directories with Java source files.
  -Xjavac-arguments=<option[,]> Java compiler arguments.
  -Xjdk-release=<version>    Compile against the specified JDK API version, similarly to javac's '-release'. This requires JDK 9 or newer.
                             The supported versions depend on the JDK used; for JDK 17+, the supported versions are 1.8 and 9–21.
                             This also sets the value of '-jvm-target' to be equal to the selected JDK version.
  -Xjspecify-annotations=ignore|strict|warn
                             Specify the behavior of 'jspecify' annotations.
                             The default value is 'warn'.
  -Xjsr305={ignore/strict/warn}|under-migration:{ignore/strict/warn}|@<fq.name>:{ignore/strict/warn}
                             Specify the behavior of 'JSR-305' nullability annotations:
                             -Xjsr305={ignore/strict/warn}                   global (all non-@UnderMigration annotations)
                             -Xjsr305=under-migration:{ignore/strict/warn}   all @UnderMigration annotations
                             -Xjsr305=@<fq.name>:{ignore/strict/warn}        annotation with the given fully qualified class name
                             Modes:
                             * ignore
                             * strict (experimental; treat like other supported nullability annotations)
                             * warn (report a warning)
  -Xjvm-default={all|all-compatibility|disable}
                             Emit JVM default methods for interface declarations with bodies. The default is 'disable'.
                             -Xjvm-default=all                Generate JVM default methods for all interface declarations with bodies in the module.
                                                              Do not generate 'DefaultImpls' stubs for interface declarations with bodies. If an interface inherits a method with a
                                                              body from an interface compiled in 'disable' mode and doesn't override it, then a 'DefaultImpls' stub will be
                                                              generated for it.
                                                              This BREAKS BINARY COMPATIBILITY if some client code relies on the presence of 'DefaultImpls' classes.
                                                              Note that if interface delegation is used, all interface methods are delegated.
                             -Xjvm-default=all-compatibility  Like 'all', but additionally generate compatibility stubs in the 'DefaultImpls' classes.
                                                              Compatibility stubs can help library and runtime authors maintain backward binary compatibility
                                                              for existing clients compiled against previous library versions.
                                                              'all' and 'all-compatibility' modes change the library ABI surface that will be used by clients after
                                                              the recompilation of the library. Because of this, clients might be incompatible with previous library
                                                              versions. This usually means that proper library versioning is required, for example with major version increases in SemVer.
                                                              In subtypes of Kotlin interfaces compiled in 'all' or 'all-compatibility' mode, 'DefaultImpls'
                                                              compatibility stubs will invoke the default method of the interface with standard JVM runtime resolution semantics.
                                                              Perform additional compatibility checks for classes inheriting generic interfaces where in some cases an
                                                              additional implicit method with specialized signatures was generated in 'disable' mode.
                                                              Unlike in 'disable' mode, the compiler will report an error if such a method is not overridden explicitly
                                                              and the class is not annotated with '@JvmDefaultWithoutCompatibility' (see KT-39603 for more details).
                             -Xjvm-default=disable            Default behavior. Do not generate JVM default methods.
  -Xklib=<path>              Paths to cross-platform libraries in the .klib format.
  -Xlambdas={class|indy}     Select the code generation scheme for lambdas.
                             -Xlambdas=indy                  Generate lambdas using 'invokedynamic' with 'LambdaMetafactory.metafactory'. This requires '-jvm-target 1.8' or greater.
                                                             A lambda object created using 'LambdaMetafactory.metafactory' will have a different 'toString()'.
                             -Xlambdas=class                 Generate lambdas as explicit classes.
  -Xlink-via-signatures      Link JVM IR symbols via signatures instead of descriptors.
                             This mode is slower, but it can be useful for troubleshooting problems with the JVM IR backend.
                             This option is deprecated and will be deleted in future versions.
                             It has no effect when -language-version is 2.0 or higher.
  -Xno-call-assertions       Don't generate not-null assertions for arguments of platform types.
  -Xno-kotlin-nothing-value-exception
                             Don't use KotlinNothingValueException, which has been available since 1.4.
  -Xno-new-java-annotation-targets
                             Don't generate Java 1.8+ targets for Kotlin annotation classes.
  -Xno-optimize              Disable optimizations.
  -Xno-optimized-callable-references
                             Don't use optimized callable reference superclasses, which have been available since 1.4.
  -Xno-param-assertions      Don't generate not-null assertions on parameters of methods accessible from Java.
  -Xno-receiver-assertions   Don't generate not-null assertions for extension receiver arguments of platform types.
  -Xno-reset-jar-timestamps  Don't reset jar entry timestamps to a fixed date.
  -Xno-source-debug-extension Don't generate the '@kotlin.jvm.internal.SourceDebugExtension' annotation with an SMAP copy on classes.
  -Xno-unified-null-checks   Use pre-1.4 exception types instead of 'java.lang.NPE' in null checks. See KT-22275 for more details.
  -Xnullability-annotations=@<fq.name>:{ignore/strict/warn}
                             Specify the behavior for specific Java nullability annotations (provided with fully qualified package name).
                             Modes:
                             * ignore
                             * strict
                             * warn (report a warning)
  -Xuse-old-innerclasses-logic Use the old logic for the generation of 'InnerClasses' attributes.
                             This option is deprecated and will be deleted in future versions.
  -Xprofile=<profilerPath:command:outputDir>
                             Debug option: Run the compiler with the async profiler and save snapshots to `outputDir`; `command` is passed to the async profiler on start.
                             `profilerPath` is the path to libasyncProfiler.so; async-profiler.jar should be on the compiler classpath.
                             If it's not on the classpath, the compiler will attempt to load async-profiler.jar from the containing directory of profilerPath.
                             Example: -Xprofile=<PATH_TO_ASYNC_PROFILER>/async-profiler/build/libasyncProfiler.so:event=cpu,interval=1ms,threads,start:<SNAPSHOT_DIR_PATH>
  -Xrepeat=<number>          Debug option: Repeat module compilation <number> times.
  -Xsam-conversions={class|indy} Select the code generation scheme for SAM conversions.
                             -Xsam-conversions=indy          Generate SAM conversions using 'invokedynamic' with 'LambdaMetafactory.metafactory'. Requires '-jvm-target 1.8' or greater.
                             -Xsam-conversions=class         Generate SAM conversions as explicit classes
  -Xsanitize-parentheses     Transform '(' and ')' in method names to some other character sequence.
                             This mode can BREAK BINARY COMPATIBILITY and should only be used as a workaround for
                             problems with parentheses in identifiers on certain platforms.
  -Xscript-resolver-environment=<key=value[,]>
                             Set the script resolver environment in key-value pairs (the value can be quoted and escaped).
  -Xserialize-ir={none|inline|all}
                             Save the IR to metadata (Experimental).
  -Xgenerate-strict-metadata-version
                             Generate metadata with strict version semantics (see the KDoc entry on 'Metadata.extraInt').
  -Xstring-concat={indy-with-constants|indy|inline}
                             Select the code generation scheme for string concatenation:
                             -Xstring-concat=indy-with-constants  Concatenate strings using 'invokedynamic' and 'makeConcatWithConstants'. This requires '-jvm-target 9' or greater.
                             -Xstring-concat=indy                 Concatenate strings using 'invokedynamic' and 'makeConcat'. This requires '-jvm-target 9' or greater.
                             -Xstring-concat=inline               Concatenate strings using 'StringBuilder'
                             default: 'indy-with-constants' for JVM targets 9 or greater, 'inline' otherwise.
  -Xsupport-compatqual-checker-framework-annotations=enable|disable
                             Specify the behavior for Checker Framework 'compatqual' annotations ('NullableDecl'/'NonNullDecl').
                             The default value is 'enable'.
  -Xsuppress-deprecated-jvm-target-warning
                             Suppress warnings about deprecated JVM target versions.
                             This option has no effect and will be deleted in a future version.
  -Xsuppress-missing-builtins-error
                             Suppress the "cannot access built-in declaration" error (useful with '-no-stdlib').
  -Xtype-enhancement-improvements-strict-mode
                             Enable strict mode for improvements to type enhancement for loaded Java types based on nullability annotations,

                             See KT-45671 for more details.
  -Xuse-fast-jar-file-system Use the fast implementation of Jar FS. This may speed up compilation time, but it is experimental.
  -Xuse-javac                Use javac for Java source and class file analysis.

                             This can be used in the event of problems with the new implementation.
  -Xuse-14-inline-classes-mangling-scheme
                             Use the scheme for inline class mangling from version 1.4 instead of the one from 1.4.30.

  -Xcheck-sticky-phase-conditions
                             Run sticky condition checks on subsequent phases. Implicitly enables '-Xcheck-phase-conditions'.
  -Xcommon-sources=<path>    Sources of the common module that need to be compiled together with this module in multiplatform mode.
                             They should be a subset of sources passed as free arguments.
  -Xcontext-receivers        Enable experimental context receivers.
  -Xdisable-default-scripting-plugin

                             The corresponding calls' declarations may not be marked with @BuilderInference.
  -Xklib-enable-signature-clash-checks
                             Enable signature uniqueness checks.
  -Xexpect-actual-classes    'expect'/'actual' classes (including interfaces, objects, annotations, enums, and 'actual' typealiases) are in Beta.
                             Kotlin reports a warning every time you use one of them. You can use this flag to mute the warning.
  -Xexplicit-api={strict|warning|disable}
                             Force the compiler to report errors on all public API declarations without an explicit visibility or a return type.
                             Use the 'warning' level to issue warnings instead of errors.
  -Xextended-compiler-checks Enable additional compiler checks that might provide verbose diagnostic information for certain errors.
                             Warning: This mode is not backward compatible and might cause compilation errors in previously compiled code.
  -Xfragment-refines=<fromModuleName>:<onModuleName>
                             Declare that <fromModuleName> refines <onModuleName> with the dependsOn/refines relation.
