    /**
     * If there's an ongoing cleanup request, wait until it's complete.
     *
     * Waiting for other threads might be tricky, because nothing prevents
     * from starting a new thread inside the [analyze] block where a new [analyze]
     * will be called.
     * Note: there are many ways to schedule some task and wait for it's completion (e.g. via threads pool),
     * so this is not only about pure threads creation.
     *
     * ### Example
     * ```kotlin
     * fun performSomeAction(declaration: KtDeclaration) { // parent thread
     *     analyze(declaration) { // 1 parent `analyze`
     *         val newThread = thread { // child thread
     *             // `scheduleCleanup` happens here
     *
     *             analyze(declaration) { // 2 child `analyze`
     *
     *             }
     *         }
     *
     *         while (newThread.isAlive) { // 3 parent waits for child
     *             ProgressManager.checkCanceled()
     *             newThread.join(50L)
     *         }
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Therefore, a naive approach with waiting for all other threads (except for [hasOngoingAnalysis] blocks)
     * might end up in deadlock ([KT-76577](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-76577)).
     *
     * To mitigate the problem, a new approach with [threadsWithAnalyze] has been chosen to avoid deadlock.
     * But this is not a perfect solution, because it, at least theoretically, might lead to a livelock
     * in some corner cases.
     *
     * For instance, in the example above, the child thread will reach the loop inside [waitForCleanupIfNeeded] while
     * the parent thread will reach the loop (3) to wait for the child thread to finish.
     * Now imagine that it is so coincident that the parent thread is always in the [Thread.State.RUNNABLE] state
     * when the child makes another iteration to check for its state via [threadsWithAnalyze]. Here we have the livelock.
     * Hense, the more actions similar to `performSomeAction` we run in parallel, the higher the probability of ending up in the livelock.
     *
     * TODO: [KT-77093](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-77093) potentially we might introduce some kind of versioning to our caches,
     * so we will be able to start new [analyze] actions without reusing the old caches, but already launched [analyze] actions will be able
     * to still access old caches, so their invariant will be preserved.
