# kotlin-metadata-jvm

This library provides an API to read and modify binary metadata in files generated by the Kotlin/JVM compiler, namely `.class` (in a form of `@kotlin.Metadata` annotation) and `.kotlin_module` files.

## Adding the library to a project

Starting with Kotlin 2.0, the kotlin-metadata-jvm library is promoted to stable and is a part of the Kotlin distribution now.
Therefore, it has the same version as Kotlin compiler and standard library, and has `org.jetbrains.kotlin` coordinates.

To use this library in your project, add a dependency on `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-metadata-jvm:$kotlin_version`.

Example usage in Gradle:

```gradle
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-metadata-jvm:$kotlin_version")
}
```

Example usage in Maven:

```xml
<project>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.jetbrains.kotlin</groupId>
            <artifactId>kotlin-metadata-jvm</artifactId>
            <version>${kotlin_version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ...
</project>
```

> To use older pre-1.0 versions of the library, use `org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-metadata-jvm` coordinates.
> Migration guide to stable versions is available [here](Migration.md).

## Reading and introspecting

The entry point for reading the Kotlin metadata of a `.class` file is [`KotlinClassMetadata.readStrict`](src/kotlinx/metadata/jvm/KotlinClassMetadata.kt).
The data it takes is the [`kotlin.Metadata`](../../stdlib/jvm/runtime/kotlin/Metadata.kt) annotation on the class file generated by the Kotlin compiler.
Obtain the `kotlin.Metadata` annotation reflectively or construct it from binary representation (e.g. by reading classfile with `org.objectweb.asm.ClassReader`),
and then use `KotlinClassMetadata.readStrict` to obtain the correct instance of the class metadata.

```kotlin
val metadataAnnotation = Metadata(
    // pass arguments here
)
val metadata = KotlinClassMetadata.readStrict(metadataAnnotation)
```

> There are other methods of reading metadata, but `readStrict` is a preferred one. See the differences in [working with different versions section](#working-with-different-versions).

`KotlinClassMetadata` is a sealed class, with subclasses representing all the different kinds of classes generated by the Kotlin compiler.
Unless you are sure that you are reading a class of a specific kind and can do a simple cast, a `when` is a good choice to handle all the possibilities:

```kotlin
when (metadata) {
    is KotlinClassMetadata.Class -> ...
    is KotlinClassMetadata.FileFacade -> ...
    is KotlinClassMetadata.SyntheticClass -> ...
    is KotlinClassMetadata.MultiFileClassFacade -> ...
    is KotlinClassMetadata.MultiFileClassPart -> ...
    is KotlinClassMetadata.Unknown -> ...
}
```

Let us assume we have obtained an instance of `KotlinClassMetadata.Class`; other kinds of classes are handled similarly, except some of them have metadata in a slightly different form.
The main way to make sense of the underlying metadata is to access the `kmClass` property, which returns an instance of `KmClass` (`Km` is a shorthand for “Kotlin metadata”):

```kotlin
val klass = metadata.kmClass
println(klass.functions.map { it.name })
println(klass.properties.map { it.name })
```

Please refer to [`MetadataSmokeTest.listInlineFunctions`](test/kotlinx/metadata/test/MetadataSmokeTest.kt) for an example where all inline functions are read from the class metadata along with their JVM signatures.

## Attributes

Most of the Km nodes (`KmClass`, `KmFunction`, `KmType`, and so on) have a set of extension properties that allow to get and set various attributes.
Most of these attributes are boolean values, but some of them, such as visibility, are represented by enum classes.
For example, you can check function visibility and presence of `suspend` modifier with corresponding extension properties:

```kotlin
val function: KmFunction = ...
if (function.visibility == Visibility.PUBLIC) {
    println("function ${function.name} is public")
}
if (function.isSuspend) {
    println("function ${function.name} has the 'suspend' modifier")
}
```

## Transforming metadata

If you transform some classes produced by Kotlin compiler (e.g., change visibilities or strip methods), then you will likely need to transform Kotlin metadata as well.
Process of doing that is relatively simple due to the fact that every property inside `KotlinClassMetadata` and Km nodes is mutable; you can rewrite/edit desired parts in-place.
After doing desired changes, the `KotlinClassMetadata.write` member method can give you the new `kotlin.Metadata` instance to put into transformed classfiles:

```kotlin
val classMetadata: KotlinClassMetadata.Class = KotlinClassMetadata.readStrict(oldAnnotation) as KotlinClassMetadata.Class
classMetadata.kmClass.functions.removeIf { it.visibility == Visibility.PRIVATE }
val newAnnotation: Metadata = classMetadata.write()
// store newAnnotation with ASM, etc.
```

It is recommended to retain the original instance of `KotlinClassMetadata.*` because it preserves `version` and `flags` from the original metadata.

To simplify the transformation process even more, there is an utility method `KotlinClassMetadata.transform` that performs reading and writing for you:

```kotlin
val oldAnnotation: Metadata = ...
val newAnnotation: Metadata = KotlinClassMetadata.transform(oldAnnotation) { metadata ->
    when(metadata) {
        is KotlinClassMetadata.Class -> metadata.kmClass.functions.removeIf { it.visibility == Visibility.PRIVATE }
        is KotlinClassMetadata.FileFacade -> metadata.kmPackage.functions.removeIf { it.visibility == Visibility.PRIVATE }
        else -> { /* no-op */ }
    }
    // at the end of the lambda, metadata is written automatically.
}
```

## Creating metadata from scratch

To create metadata of a Kotlin class file from scratch, first, construct an instance of `KmClass`/`KmPackage`/`KmLambda`, and fill it with the data.
When using metadata writers from Kotlin source code, it is very convenient to use Kotlin scoping functions such as `apply` to reduce boilerplate:

```kotlin
// Writing metadata of a class
val klass = KmClass().apply {
    // Setting the name and the modifiers of the class.
    name = "MyClass"
    visibility = Visibility.PUBLIC

    // Adding one public primary constructor
    constructors += KmConstructor().apply {
        visibility = Visibility.PUBLIC
        isSecondary = false
        // Setting the JVM signature (for example, to be used by kotlin-reflect)
        signature = JvmMethodSignature("<init>", "()V")
    }

    ...
}
```

Then, you can put a resulting `KmClass`/`KmPackage`/`KmLambda` into an appropriate container and write it.
Pay attention to the metadata version. Usually, `JvmMetadataVersion.LATEST_STABLE_SUPPORTED` is a good choice, but you may want to write a specific version you obtained from existing Kotlin classfiles in your project.
You also have to set up the `flags`. For description of all the available flags, see [Metadata.extraInt](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-metadata/extra-int.html).
`0` (no flags) may be a good choice, but in case you already have some ground truth files in your project, you may want to copy flags from them.

```kotlin
val classMetadata = KotlinClassMetadata.Class(klass, JvmMetadataVersion.LATEST_STABLE_SUPPORTED, 0)
val newAnnotation: Metadata = classMetadata.write()
// Write annotation directly or use annotation.kind, annotation.data1, annotation.data2, etc.
```

Please refer to [`MetadataSmokeTest.produceKotlinClassFile`](test/kotlinx/metadata/test/MetadataSmokeTest.kt) for an example where metadata of a simple Kotlin class is created,
and then the class file is produced with ASM and loaded by Kotlin reflection.

## Working with different versions

### Short guide

There are two methods to read metadata:

`readStrict()`: This method allows you to read the metadata strictly, meaning it will throw an exception if the metadata version is greater than what kotlin-metadata-jvm understands.
It's suitable when your tooling can't tolerate reading potentially incomplete or incorrect information due to version differences.
It's also the only method that allows metadata transformation and `KotlinClassMetadata.write` subsequent calls.

`readLenient()`: This method allows you to read the metadata leniently. 
If the metadata version is higher than what kotlin-metadata-jvm can interpret, it may ignore parts of the metadata it doesn't understand.
It’s more suitable when your tooling needs to read metadata of possibly newer Kotlin versions and can handle incomplete data, because it is interested only in part of it (e.g. visibility of declarations).
Keep in mind that this method will still throw an exception if metadata is changed in an unpredictable way.
**Metadata read in lenient mode can not be written back.**

### Detailed explanation

Kotlin compiler and its features evolve over time, and so does its metadata format. Metadata format version is equal to the Kotlin compiler version.
Naturally, evolving the metadata format may result in various changes, from adding new information to changing metadata format entirely for the new Kotlin language features.
Therefore, some problems may occur when you're reading new metadata with an older version of Kotlin compiler or kotlin-metadata-jvm library.

By default, the Kotlin/JVM compiler (and similar, kotlin-metadata-jvm library) has [forward compatibility](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-evolution.html#evolving-the-binary-format) for versions not higher than current + 1.
It means that Kotlin compiler 2.1 can read metadata from Kotlin compiler 2.2, but not 2.3. The same is true for `KotlinClassMetadata.readStrict()`
method: it will throw an exception if you try to read metadata with version higher than `JvmMetadataVersion.LATEST_STABLE_SUPPORTED` + 1.
Such restriction comes from the fact that higher metadata versions (e.g. 2.3) might have some unexpected format that can be read incorrectly; therefore, if we write 
transformed metadata back, this can result in corrupted metadata that is no longer valid for version 2.3.

However, there are a lot of use cases for metadata introspection alone, without further transformations — for example, [binary-compatibility-validator](https://github.com/Kotlin/binary-compatibility-validator) which is interested only in visibility and modality of declarations.
For such use cases it seems overly restrictive to prohibit reading newer metadata versions (and therefore, requiring authors to do frequent updates of kotlin-metadata-jvm dependency),
so there is a relaxed version of the reading method: `KotlinClassMetadata.readLenient()`. It is a best-effort reading method that will try to build metadata based on the format we currently know,
and provide some access to it. Keep in mind that this method has limitations:

1. Metadata returned by this method can not be written back, because we are not sure if it is still valid format for newer versions. It is intended for introspection alone.
2. We cannot guarantee that metadata is not changed in the other unpredictable ways in the future. `readLenient()` tries its best, but still can throw a decoding exception or even return incorrect result.

## Module metadata

Similarly to how `KotlinClassMetadata` is used to read/write metadata of Kotlin `.class` files, [`KotlinModuleMetadata`](src/kotlinx/metadata/jvm/KotlinModuleMetadata.kt)
is the entry point for reading/writing `.kotlin_module` files. Use `KotlinModuleMetadata.read` or `KotlinModuleMetadata.write` in very much the same fashion as with the class files.
The only difference is that the source for the reader (and the result of the writer) is a simple byte array, not the structured data loaded from `kotlin.Metadata`:

```kotlin
// Read the module metadata
val bytes = File("META-INF/main.kotlin_module").readBytes()
val moduleMetadata = KotlinModuleMetadata.read(bytes)
val module = moduleMetadata.kmModule
...

// Write the module metadata
val bytes = moduleMetadata.write()
File("META-INF/main.kotlin_module").writeBytes(bytes)
```
