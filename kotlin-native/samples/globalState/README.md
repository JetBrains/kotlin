# Shared global state

This example shows how one could implement global shared state using interop mechanisms.

To build use `../gradlew assemble`.

To run use `../gradlew runReleaseExecutableGlobalState` or execute the program directly:

    ./build/bin/globalState/main/release/executable/globalState.kexe
