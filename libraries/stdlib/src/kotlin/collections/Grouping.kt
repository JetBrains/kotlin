/**
 * Represents a source of elements with a [keyOf] function, which can be applied to each element to get its key.
 *
 * A [Grouping] structure serves as an intermediate step in group-and-fold operations:
 * they group elements by their keys and then fold each group with some aggregating operation.
 *
 * It is created by attaching `keySelector: (T) -> K` function to a source of elements.
 * To get an instance of [Grouping] use one of `groupingBy` extension functions:
 * - [Iterable.groupingBy]
 * - [Sequence.groupingBy]
 * - [Array.groupingBy]
 * - [CharSequence.groupingBy]
 *
 * For the list of group-and-fold operations available, see the [extension functions](#extension-functions) for `Grouping`.
