# Curl interop library

This example shows how to build and publish an interop library to communicate with the libcurl,
HTTP/HTTPS/FTP/etc client library. Debian-like distros may need to 
`apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev`.

To build use `../gradlew assemble`

To publish the library into a local repo use `../gradlew publish`
