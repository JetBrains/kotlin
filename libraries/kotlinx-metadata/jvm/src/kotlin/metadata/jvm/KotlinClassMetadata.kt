/**
 * Represents the parsed metadata of a Kotlin JVM class file. Entry point for parsing metadata on JVM.
 *
 * To create an instance of [KotlinClassMetadata], first obtain an instance of [Metadata] annotation on a class file,
 * and then call [KotlinClassMetadata.readStrict] or [KotlinClassMetadata.readLenient], depending on your application (see 'Working with different versions' section in the readme).
 *
 * [Metadata] annotation can be obtained either via reflection or created from data from a binary class file, using its constructor or helper function [kotlin.metadata.jvm.Metadata].
 *
 * [KotlinClassMetadata] alone exposes only [KotlinClassMetadata.version] and [KotlinClassMetadata.flags];
 * to work with it, it is required to do a `when` over subclasses.
 * Different subclasses of [KotlinClassMetadata] represent different kinds of class files produced by Kotlin compiler.
 * It is recommended to study documentation for each subclass and decide what subclasses one has to handle in the `when` expression,
 * trying to cover as much as possible.
 * Normally, one would need at least a [Class] and a [FileFacade], as these are two most common kinds.
 *
 * Most of the subclasses declare a property to view metadata as a Km data structure â€” for example, [KotlinClassMetadata.Class.kmClass].
 * Some of them also can contain additional properties, e.g. [KotlinClassMetadata.MultiFileClassPart.facadeClassName].
 * Km data structures represent Kotlin declarations and offer a variety of properties to introspect and alter them.
 * After desired changes are made to a Km data structure or to [KotlinClassMetadata] itself,
 * it is possible to get a new raw metadata instance with a [write] function.
 *
 * > If metadata has been read with [readLenient], [write] will throw an exception.
 *
 * Here is an example of reading a content name of some metadata:
 * ```
 * fun displayName(metadata: Metadata): String = when (val kcm = KotlinClassMetadata.readStrict(metadata)) {
 *     is KotlinClassMetadata.Class -> "Class ${kcm.kmClass.name}"
 *     is KotlinClassMetadata.FileFacade -> "File facade with functions: ${kcm.kmPackage.functions.joinToString { it.name }}"
 *     is KotlinClassMetadata.SyntheticClass -> kcm.kmLambda?.function?.name?.let { "Lambda $it" } ?: "Synthetic class"
 *     is KotlinClassMetadata.MultiFileClassFacade -> "Multifile class facade with parts: ${kcm.partClassNames.joinToString()}"
 *     is KotlinClassMetadata.MultiFileClassPart -> "Multifile class part ${kcm.facadeClassName}"
 *     is KotlinClassMetadata.Unknown -> "Unknown metadata"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * > In this example, only introspection (reading) is performed. In such cases, to support broader range of metadata versions, you may also use [readLenient] method.
