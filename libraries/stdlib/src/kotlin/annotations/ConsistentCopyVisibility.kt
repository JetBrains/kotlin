/**
 * In previous versions of Kotlin, the generated 'copy' method of a data class always had public visibility,
 * even if the primary constructor was non-public. That exposed the non-public constructor of the data class.
 *
 * In future versions of Kotlin,
 * the generated 'copy' method of a data class will have the same visibility as the primary constructor.
 *
 * When you apply the [ConsistentCopyVisibility] annotation to a data class with non-public constructor:
 * 1. The generated 'copy' method will have the same visibility as the primary constructor.
 *    You enroll into the new behavior right away.
 * 2. You disable all the warnings/errors about the behavior change because they become unnecessary.
 *
 * The effect of '-Xconsistent-data-copy-visibility' flag is the same as applying [ConsistentCopyVisibility] to all data classes in the module.
 *
 * ## Deprecation timeline
 *
 * - **Phase 1.** Kotlin 2.0.20.
 *   The compiler warns about the behavior change on the data class declaration and on 'copy' method usages.
 *   It's possible to suppress the warning on the declaration with [ConsistentCopyVisibility]/[ExposedCopyVisibility] annotations or the '-Xconsistent-data-copy-visibility' flag.
 *   It's impossible to suppress the warning on illegal 'copy' method usages.
 *   Illegal usages should start the migration.
 * - **Phase 2.** (Supposedly Kotlin 2.1). The warnings turn into errors.
 *   It's possible to suppress the error on the declaration with [ConsistentCopyVisibility]/[ExposedCopyVisibility] annotations or the '-Xconsistent-data-copy-visibility' flag.
 *   It's impossible to suppress the error on illegal 'copy' method usages.
 *   Illegal usages should migrate.
 * - **Phase 3.** (Supposedly Kotlin 2.2). The default changes.
 *   Unless [ExposedCopyVisibility] is used, the generated 'copy' method has the same visibility as the primary constructor.
 *   The error on the declaration is no longer reported.
 *   '-Xconsistent-data-copy-visibility' compiler flag and [ConsistentCopyVisibility] annotation are now unnecessary.
 *
 * For the exact mapping of deprecation phases and Kotlin versions follow [KT-11914](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-11914).
 *
 * You can turn the warning into an error by using the '-progressive' compiler flag.
 *
 * ## Recommendation and alternatives
 *
 * - If you write new code or don't care about binary compatibility,
 *   it's recommended to use [ConsistentCopyVisibility] (or '-Xconsistent-data-copy-visibility' compiler flag) instead of the [ExposedCopyVisibility].
 * - When you use [ExposedCopyVisibility], it's also recommended to use '-Xconsistent-data-copy-visibility' in the same module.
 *   This way, old classes won't change their behavior, but new classes will have the correct visibility of the 'copy' method.
 * - Once all the illegal 'copy' method usages are migrated, please drop the [ExposedCopyVisibility] annotation.
 * - You can introduce your own 'copy'-like method alongside the generated 'copy',
 *   and migrate all the usages to the introduced method.
 * - You can rewrite your data class to regular Kotlin class.
 *   You need to manually implement all the data class generated methods.
