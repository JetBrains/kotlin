/**
 * A fully qualified name of a classifier from the Kotlin's point of view. May differ from the JVM name of the class
 * which is the runtime representation of this Kotlin classifier (for example, Kotlin class "kotlin/Int" -> JVM class "java/lang/Integer")
 *
 * Package names in this name are separated by '/', and class names are separated by '.', for example: `"org/foo/bar/Baz.Nested"`.
 *
 * If this name starts with '.', it represents a local class or an anonymous object. This is used by the Kotlin compiler
 * to prevent lookup of this name in the resolution.
