## Triage fields

Each Q (and sub-question, where present) carries:

- **Status**: open | in-design | blocked | resolved
- **Owner**: @handle or "unassigned"
- **YT**: KT-XXXXX or "—"
- **Target doc**: relative link where the resolution lands
- **Last touched**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Q1. ~~LightTree path for `FirScript`~~ — resolved

- Status: resolved
- Owner: —
- YT: —
- Target doc: [`../current/10-compiler-representation.md`](../current/10-compiler-representation.md)
- Last touched: 2026-05-16

**Resolved**: scripts already use LT exclusively on the K2 path. See `ScriptJvmK2CompilerImpl` + `convertToFirViaLightTree` + `LightTreeRawFirDeclarationBuilder.buildScript()`. No work needed.

## Q2. LightTree path for `FirReplSnippet` — KT-83498

- Status: in-design (canonical home moved to [`50-migration-plan.md`](50-migration-plan.md) step 2)
- Owner: unassigned
- YT: KT-83498
- Target doc: [`50-migration-plan.md`](50-migration-plan.md#2-land-kt-83498--full-lighttree-path-for-k2replcompiler)
- Last touched: 2026-05-16

Tracked as migration-plan step 2. Sub-questions (priority, shape — `convertToFir` lambda vs hardwired LT) are recorded inline in step 2 "Design notes".

## Q3. ~~`scripting-ide-services` — delete or salvage?~~ — resolved

- Status: resolved
- Owner: —
- YT: —
- Target doc: [`50-migration-plan.md`](50-migration-plan.md#9-delete-scripting-ide-services--companions)
- Last touched: 2026-05-16

**Resolved**: delete confirmed. Future reimplementation possible in a different form, definitely without K1.

## Q4. ~~`scripting-ide-common` — what stays?~~ — resolved

- Status: resolved
- Owner: —
- YT: —
- Target doc: [`50-migration-plan.md`](50-migration-plan.md#10-delete-scripting-ide-common)
- Last touched: 2026-05-16

**Resolved**: delete entirely confirmed. Future reimplementation possible in a different form, definitely without K1.

## Q5. JSR-223 remote compilation — stateless design

- Status: in-design (umbrella; per-sub TBD)
- Owner: unassigned
- YT: — (umbrella)
- Target doc: [`40-jsr223-target.md#remote-out-of-process-compilation`](40-jsr223-target.md)
- Last touched: 2026-05-16

**Settled**: stateless snippet compilation (snippet artifacts = class files + sidecar metadata). At least one IntelliJ consumer relies on out-of-process JSR-223 compilation today.

| Sub | Question | Status | Owner | YT | Last touched |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q5a | Reconstruction feasibility: can `FirReplSnippetSymbol` + `FirReplSnippetResolveExtension.getSnippetScope` be implemented over symbols rebuilt from on-disk class metadata + sidecar? | open — prototype needed | unassigned | — | 2026-05-16 |
| Q5b | Sidecar format (JSON / proto / hand-rolled binary) + versioning strategy | open | unassigned | — | 2026-05-16 |
| Q5c | Performance: O(N²) FIR reconstruction risk for long sessions; caller-side caching strategy? | open | unassigned | — | 2026-05-16 |
| Q5d | Transport: BTA `CompileReplSnippetOperation` vs direct in-process embedding (post IntelliJ-platform-dep cleanup) — probably both eventually | in-design | unassigned | — | 2026-05-16 |
| Q5e | Migration window: K1 daemon bridge breaks before stateless lands; IntelliJ consumer pin to a Kotlin version during transition? | blocked on Q5a + step 3 prototype | unassigned | — | 2026-05-16 |

## Q6. Classpath-based script definition discovery (KT-82551)

- Status: in-design (default: un-deprecate + document, plan SPI replacement separately)
- Owner: unassigned
- YT: KT-82551
- Target doc: [`30-embedding-target.md`](30-embedding-target.md#script-definition-discovery)
- Last touched: 2026-05-16

`META-INF/kotlin/script/templates/*.classname` markers are deprecated, but no successor exists. `kotlin-main-kts` and third-party defs depend on it.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| Un-deprecate, document as the SPI | Cheapest; accepts current contract |
| Replace with `ServiceLoader<ScriptDefinitionContributor>` SPI | Modern Java SPI; requires definition modules to adapt |
| Keep deprecated forever | Status quo; bad signal |

## Q7. ~~`libraries/scripting/intellij` — move or delete?~~ — resolved

- Status: resolved (KEEP)
- Owner: —
- YT: —
- Target doc: [`20-api-target.md`](20-api-target.md)
- Last touched: 2026-05-16

**Resolved**: KEEP. Used by IntelliJ plugin authors to wire custom-scripts support. Not a candidate for removal or relocation.

## Q8. `IrScript` schema: drop K1-only fields

- Status: open (gated on whole-compiler K1 retirement)
- Owner: unassigned
- YT: —
- Target doc: [`10-compiler-target.md`](10-compiler-target.md#ir)
- Last touched: 2026-05-16

`providedProperties`, `providedPropertiesParameters` are unused on K2. After K1 frontend retires, regen `IrScript` without them.

Side question: should K2 actually unify provided properties + explicit call parameters (current K2 behavior) or split them back out for clarity? Argues for keeping the field but document its K2 semantics.

## Q9. ~~Single configurator extension vs split~~ — resolved

- Status: resolved (KEEP split)
- Owner: —
- YT: —
- Target doc: [`10-compiler-target.md`](10-compiler-target.md)
- Last touched: 2026-05-16

`FirScript*` and `FirReplSnippet*` have separate but parallel sets of configurator / resolution / Fir2Ir extensions (6 EPs total). The script and snippet shapes diverge enough to keep split. No work.

## Q10. K2 binding semantics in REPL — settled, sub-questions remain

- Status: in-design (umbrella; sub-questions tracked below)
- Owner: unassigned
- YT: — (umbrella)
- Target doc: [`40-jsr223-target.md`](40-jsr223-target.md)
- Last touched: 2026-05-16

**Settled**: pursue **Option D** in [`40-jsr223-target.md`](40-jsr223-target.md) — implicit-snippets refinement-DSL callback + a JSR-223 binding configurator that emits a delegating-property snippet on binding diffs.

| Sub | Question | Status | Owner | YT | Last touched |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q10a | DSL naming: settled as `prependSyntheticSnippets`. See [iterations/2026-05-17_bindings-partial.md](../iterations/2026-05-17_bindings-partial.md) | resolved | unassigned | — | 2026-05-17 |
| Q10b | Implicit-snippet tagging in `FirReplHistoryProvider`: needs an EP "implicit" tag, or caller-side bookkeeping? | open | unassigned | — | 2026-05-16 |
| Q10c | Removal semantics: when a binding name is removed, what does the next snippet emit? Shadowing marker vs delegate-throws-at-access | open — decide during prototyping | unassigned | — | 2026-05-16 |
| Q10d | Type stability: if a binding's runtime type changes, re-emit new delegating property (shadow old) vs fail? Probably re-emit; confirm | open — decide during prototyping | unassigned | — | 2026-05-16 |
| Q10e | Bootstrap timing: canonical `bindings` accessor emitted once on first non-empty `Bindings`; clear+rebind edge case | open — decide during impl | unassigned | — | 2026-05-16 |
| Q10f | Composability with other handlers: registration order, sorted by priority key, or undefined? | open | unassigned | — | 2026-05-16 |

## Q11. Public stability of `JvmScriptCompiler.createLegacy()` etc.

- Status: open (owner needed)
- Owner: unassigned
- YT: —
- Target doc: [`50-migration-plan.md`](50-migration-plan.md#7-delete-jvm-host-legacy-repl-wrappers)
- Last touched: 2026-05-16

These are not annotated `@SinceKotlin` / `@ExperimentalApi` everywhere. Confirm we can remove them without a deprecation cycle, or budget the cycle in.

## Q12. Generated test runners

- Status: open — quick audit
- Owner: unassigned
- YT: —
- Target doc: [`50-migration-plan.md`](50-migration-plan.md#12-compiler-side-scripting-test-cleanup)
- Last touched: 2026-05-16

`plugins/scripting/scripting-tests/` includes generated runners (`*TestGenerated.java`). After deletions, re-run `./gradlew generateTests`. Confirm nothing else generates scripting-related test classes outside this module.

## Q13. K2 REPL `IR_EXTERNAL_DECLARATION_STUB` on `@InlineOnly` / `[fake_override]`

- Status: in-design (canonical home moved to [`50-migration-plan.md`](50-migration-plan.md) step **1b**)
- Owner: unassigned
- YT: — (to be filed; cross-link here once a YT issue exists)
- Target doc: [`50-migration-plan.md`](50-migration-plan.md#1b-fix-k2-repl-ir_external_declaration_stub)
- Last touched: 2026-05-18

K2 REPL pipeline currently emits `IR_EXTERNAL_DECLARATION_STUB` for `@InlineOnly` stdlib members and for some cross-snippet fake-overrides. `ExpressionCodegen` cannot lower those stubs, so the compile/eval pipeline fails with "Unhandled intrinsic in ExpressionCodegen: FUN IR_EXTERNAL_DECLARATION_STUB". This is the single largest source of red tests on the JSR-223 suite (4–6 of 9 failures depending on call shape). See [`../current/80-known-gotchas.md`](../current/80-known-gotchas.md#g1-ir_external_declaration_stub-on-inlineonly-members-in-snippet-eval) (G1) and (G2).

Two sub-questions (each independently delegate-able):

| Sub | Question | Status | Owner | YT | Last touched |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q13a | `@InlineOnly` deserialisation: should the K2 REPL Fir2Ir pipeline run the inliner phase on declarations imported from stdlib `klib`/jar with `@InlineOnly`, or should ` IrLazyDeclarations` keep the body materialised for those members regardless of inliner ordering? | open — investigation in progress, see iteration `2026-05-18_codegen-stub-investigation` | unassigned | — | 2026-05-18 |
| Q13b | Cross-snippet fake-override resolution: when a user snippet calls a member inherited by a class defined in a previous snippet's FIR module, why does the fake-override resolver fail to materialise the override chain? Is this a fix in `IrFakeOverrideBuilder` (or its REPL-aware subclass), or does the REPL session need to compose FIR modules differently so the inheritance chain is internal-to-module? | open | unassigned | — | 2026-05-18 |

## Q14. JVM-safe binding-name encoding for JSR-223

- Status: open — design needed
- Owner: unassigned
- YT: —
- Target doc: [`40-jsr223-target.md`](40-jsr223-target.md)
- Last touched: 2026-05-18

K1 contract escaped JSR-223 binding names that aren't Kotlin identifiers using a `\`-prefixed escape table (`.` → `\,`, `:` → `\!`, ...). On K2 the JVM names checker (`FirJvmNamesChecker.INVALID_CHARS`) rejects `\` along with `.`, `:`, `;`, `[`, `]`, `/`, `<`, `>`, so the K1 escape scheme cannot be honoured. Underscore-only fallbacks collide with the parser rule "Names `_`, `__`, `___`, ... are reserved". See [`../current/80-known-gotchas.md`](../current/80-known-gotchas.md#g8-jvm-identifier-constraints-block---based-binding-name-escaping) (G8).

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| Prefix-encoded ASCII (e.g. `__dot__`, `__colon__`) | Reversible, JVM-safe; clutters generated source; needs an underscore prefix to dodge the reserved-name rule (e.g. `n__dot__name`). |
| Punycode-style | Reversible, compact, well-specified; verbose for common cases; needs a small Kotlin impl. |
| Bind-only on subset, expose remainder via `bindings["..."]` | Cheapest; some K1 binding scenarios silently lose property access. |
| Rewrite the contract: drop typed properties for non-identifier names entirely; mute `testEvalWithContextNamesWithSymbols` | Cleanest; explicit K1 → K2 contract change; needs sign-off. |

## Q15. Lambda / anonymous-class binding-type rendering

- Status: in-design — generator-side filter landed; typed-access decision deferred
- Owner: unassigned
- YT: —
- Target doc: [`40-jsr223-target.md`](40-jsr223-target.md)
- Last touched: 2026-05-18

When a JSR-223 binding's runtime value is an indy-lambda (`-Xlambdas=indy`) or a local/anonymous class, `KClass.qualifiedName` may be non-null but not a valid Kotlin type reference (e.g. `Foo$$Lambda$1`, `MyKt$f$lambda$1`). Embedding it into synthetic-snippet source breaks the parser. See [`../current/80-known-gotchas.md`](../current/80-known-gotchas.md#g9-lambda-binding-types-have-non-parseable-qualifiedname) (G9).

Current state: `propertiesFromContext.kt` filters such bindings with `isParseableKotlinQualifiedName(qn)`; they remain accessible via `bindings["..."]` but not as typed properties. Open question: do we want typed access (e.g. emit `var foo: (Int) -> Int` by inspecting the functional-interface signature) or keep the current "skip with `Any?` fallback" behaviour? Decision rides on whether typed lambda accessors are a stated JSR-223 K2 contract.

## Q16. JSR-223 K2 implicit-receiver strategy

- Status: open — design needed
- Owner: unassigned
- YT: —
- Target doc: [`40-jsr223-target.md`](40-jsr223-target.md)
- Last touched: 2026-05-18

K1 path exposed bindings via helpers receiving `ScriptTemplateWithBindings`. K2 path uses `ScriptContext` as `$$eval`'s implicit receiver, so user-defined `fun ScriptTemplateWithBindings.foo(...)` is unreachable. See [`../current/80-known-gotchas.md`](../current/80-known-gotchas.md#g10-k2-jsr-223-implicit-receiver-is-scriptcontext-not-scripttemplatewithbindings) (G10).

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| Drop `ScriptTemplateWithBindings` helper API; document the K2 contract as "extension receivers must be on `ScriptContext` or `Bindings`" | Cleanest; breaks existing user code that used the K1 extension shape. |
| Add a second implicit receiver (`ScriptTemplateWithBindings`) on K2 `$$eval` | Backwards-compatible; risk of ambiguous-receiver diagnostics; needs FIR snippet-resolve EP support. |
| Switch the JSR-223 script template entirely (so the K2 `$$eval` receiver IS `ScriptTemplateWithBindings`) | Compatible-by-construction; ripples through `KotlinJsr223DefaultScript` + every snippet's compilation config. |
