## Browser API

Provides a simple typesafe API for accessing the browser context which can be used when Kotlin is compiled into JavaScript or when Kotlin is used on a JVM for example using [JavaFX](https://github.com/koolapp/koolapp/tree/master/koolapp-javafx), custom browser widgets such as in SWT or Qt, with remote control browser APIs like GWT or Selenium.
