/**
 * This annotation is used on IR API elements which use front-end (FE) descriptors to obtain information, directly or indirectly.
 *
 * Descriptors are used in FE to represent main declaration properties and to refer declarations.
 * Early IR versions were descriptor-based, so IR elements used descriptors to obtain some information about element properties.
 * However, more correct and universal way is to store all necessary information inside IR elements themselves
 * and do not use descriptors as some intermediate storage. It's planned to remove all descriptor usages from IR in future.
