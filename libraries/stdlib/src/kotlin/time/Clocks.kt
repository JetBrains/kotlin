 * Creates a [Clock] that uses the [time mark at the moment of creation][TimeSource.markNow] to determine how [far][TimeMark.elapsedNow]

 *
 * This clock stores the [TimeMark] at the moment of creation, so repeatedly creating [Clock]s from the same [TimeSource] results
 * in different [Instant]s iff the time of the [TimeSource] was increased. To sync different [Clock]s, use the [origin]
 * parameter.
