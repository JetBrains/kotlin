/**
 * A cache with strong references to its keys [K] and non-strong references to its values [V], which will be cleaned up after manual removal
 * and garbage collection. **The cache should only be used in read/write actions, as specified by the individual functions.**
 *
 * Each value of the cache has a [ValueReferenceCleaner] associated with it. The cache ensures that this cleaner is invoked when the value
 * is removed from or replaced in the cache, or when the value has been garbage-collected. Already collected values from the cache's
 * reference queue are guaranteed to be processed on mutating operations (such as `put`, `remove`, and so on). The [ValueReferenceCleaner]
 * will be strongly referenced from the cache until collected values have been processed.
 *
 * `null` keys or values are not allowed.
