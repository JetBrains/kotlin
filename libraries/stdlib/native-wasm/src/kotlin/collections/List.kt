/**
 * A generic ordered collection of elements. The interface allows iterating over contained elements,
 * accessing elements by index, checking if a list contains some elements, and searching indices for particular values.
 * Complex operations are built upon this functionality and provided in form of [kotlin.collections] extension functions.
 *
 * Functions in this interface support only read-only access to the list;
 * read/write access is supported through the [MutableList] interface.
 *
 * In addition to a regular iteration, it is possible to obtain [ListIterator] using [listIterator] that provides
 * bidirectional iteration facilities, and allows accessing elements' indices in addition to their values.
 *
 * It is possible to get a view over a continuous span of elements using [subList].
 *
 * Unlike [Set], lists can contain duplicate elements.
 *
 * Unlike [Collection] implementations, [List] implementations must override [Any.toString], [Any.equals] and [Any.hashCode] functions
 * and provide implementations such that:
 * - [List.toString] should return a string containing string representation of contained elements in exact same order
 *   these elements are stored within the list.
 * - [List.equals] should consider two lists equal if and only if they contain the same number of elements and each element
 *   in one list is equal to an element in another list at the same index. Unlike some other `equals` implementations, [List.equals]
 *   should consider two lists equal even if they are instances of different classes; the only requirement here is that both lists have
 *   to implement [List] interface.
 * - [List.hashCode] should be computed as a combination of elements' hash codes using the following algorithm:
 *   ```kotlin
 *   var hashCode: Int = 1
 *   for (element in this) hashCode = hashCode * 31 + element.hashCode()
 *   ```
 *
 * @param E the type of elements contained in the list. The list is covariant in its element type.
