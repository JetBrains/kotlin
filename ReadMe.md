## Build environment requirements

In order to build Kotlin distribution you need to have:

- JDK 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 and 9
- Setup environment variables as following:

        JAVA_HOME="path to JDK 1.8"
        JDK_16="path to JDK 1.6"
        JDK_17="path to JDK 1.7"
        JDK_18="path to JDK 1.8"
        JDK_9="path to JDK 9"

For local development, if you're not working on bytecode generation or the standard library, it's OK to have only JDK 1.8 and JDK 9 installed, and to point JDK_16 and JDK_17 environment variables to your JDK 1.8 installation.

You also can use [Gradle properties](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:gradle_properties_and_system_properties) to setup JDK_* variables.

> Note: The JDK 6 for MacOS is not available on Oracle's site. You can [download it here](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572). 

## Building

The project is built with Gradle. Run Gradle to build the project and to run the tests 
using the following command on Unix/macOS:

    ./gradlew <tasks-and-options>
    
or the following command on Windows:

    gradlew <tasks-and-options>

On the first project configuration gradle will download and setup the dependencies on

* `intellij-core` is a part of command line compiler and contains only necessary APIs.
* `idea-full` is a full blown IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition to be used in the plugin module.

These dependencies are quite large, so depending on the quality of your internet connection 
you might face timeouts getting them. In this case you can increase timeout by specifying the following 
command line parameters on the first run: 
    
    ./gradlew -Dhttp.socketTimeout=60000 -Dhttp.connectionTimeout=60000

## Important gradle tasks

- `clean` - clean build results
- `dist` - assembles the compiler distribution into `dist/kotlinc/` folder
- `ideaPlugin` - assembles the Kotlin IDEA plugin distribution into `dist/artifacts/Kotlin` folder
- `install` - build and install all public artifacts into local maven repository
- `runIde` - build IDEA plugin and run IDEA with it
- `coreLibsTest` - build and run stdlib, reflect and kotlin-test tests
- `gradlePluginTest` - build and run gradle plugin tests
- `compilerTest` - build and run all compiler tests
- `ideaPluginTest` - build and run all IDEA plugin tests

**OPTIONAL:** Some artifacts, mainly Maven plugin ones, are built separately with Maven.
Refer to [libraries/ReadMe.md](libraries/ReadMe.md) for details.


### Building for different versions of IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio

Kotlin plugin is intended to work with several recent versions of IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio. Each platform is allowed to have a different set of features and might provide a slightly different API. Instead of using several parallel Git branches, project stores everything in a single branch, but files may have counterparts with version extensions (\*.as32, \*.172, \*.181). The primary file is expected to be replaced with its counterpart when targeting non-default platform.

More detailed description of this scheme can be found at https://github.com/JetBrains/bunches/blob/master/ReadMe.md.

Usually, there's no need to care about multiple platforms as all features are enabled everywhere by default. Additional counterparts should be created if there's an expected difference in behavior or an incompatible API usage is required **and** there's no reasonable workaround to save source compatibility. Kotlin plugin contains a pre-commit check that shows a warning if a file has been updated without its counterparts.

Development for some particular platform is possible after 'switching' that can be done with [Bunch Tool](https://github.com/JetBrains/bunches/releases) from the command line.

```sh
cd kotlin-project-dir

# switching to IntelliJ Idea 2018.2
bunch switch . 182
```

## <a name="working-in-idea"></a> Working with the project in IntelliJ IDEA

Working with the Kotlin project requires at least IntelliJ IDEA 2017.3. You can download IntelliJ IDEA 2017.3 [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download).

After cloning the project, to import the project in Intellij choose the project directory in the Open project dialog. Then, after project opened, Select 
`File` -> `New...` -> `Module from Existing Sources` in the menu, and select `build.gradle.kts` file in the project's root folder.

In the import dialog, select `use default gradle wrapper`.

To be able to run tests from IntelliJ easily, check `Delegate IDE build/run actions to Gradle` and choose `Gradle Test Runner` in the Gradle runner settings after importing the project.

At this time, you can use the latest released 1.2.x version of the Kotlin plugin for working with the code. To make sure you have the latest version installed, use Tools | Kotlin | Configure Kotlin Plugin Updates and press "Check for updates now".

### Compiling and running

From this root project there are Run/Debug Configurations for running IDEA or the Compiler Tests for example; so if you want to try out the latest and greatest IDEA plugin

* VCS -> Git -> Pull
* Run the "IDEA" run configuration in the project
* a child IntelliJ IDEA with the Kotlin plugin will then startup

### Including into composite build

To include kotlin compiler into [composite build](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html) you need to define `dependencySubstitution` for `kotlin-compiler` module in `settings.gradle`

```
includeBuild('/path/to/kotlin') {
    dependencySubstitution {
        substitute module('org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-compiler') with project(':include:kotlin-compiler')
    }
}
```

          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
