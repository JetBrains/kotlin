/**
 * # NPM resolution state manager
 *
 * ## Resolving process from Gradle
 *
 * **configuring**. Global initial state. [NpmResolverPlugin] should be applied for each project
 * that requires NPM resolution. When applied, [KotlinProjectNpmResolver] will be created for the
 * corresponding project and will subscribe to all js compilations. [NpmResolverPlugin] requires
 * kotlin mulitplatform or plaform plugin applied first.
 *
 * **up-to-date-checked**. This state is compilation local: one compilation may be in up-to-date-checked
 * state, while another may be steel in configuring state. New compilations may be added in this
 * state, but compilations that are already up-to-date-checked cannot be changed.
 * Initiated by calling [KotlinPackageJsonTask.producerInputs] getter (will be called by Gradle).
 * [KotlinCompilationNpmResolver] will create and **resolve** aggregated compilation configuration,
 * which contains all related compilation configuration and NPM tools configuration.
 * NPM tools configuration contains all dependencies that is required for all enabled
 * tasks related to this compilation. It is important to resolve this configuration inside particular
 * project and not globally. Aggregated configuration will be analyzed for gradle internal dependencies
 * (project dependencies), gradle external dependencies and npm dependencies. This collections will
 * be treated as `packageJson` task inputs.
 *
 * **package-json-created**. This state also compilation local. Initiated by executing `packageJson`
 * task for particular compilation. If `packageJson` task is up-to-date, this state is reached by
 * first calling [KotlinCompilationNpmResolver.getResolutionOrResolveIfForced] which may be called
 * by compilation that depends on this compilation. Note that package.json will be executed only for
 * required compilations, while other may be missed.
 *
 * **Prepared**.
 * Global final state. Initiated by executing global `rootPackageJson` task.
 *
 * **Installed**.
 * All created package.json files will be gathered and package manager will be executed.
 * Package manager will create lock file, that will be parsed for transitive npm dependencies
 * that will be added to the root [NpmDependency] objects. `kotlinNpmInstall` task may be up-to-date.
 * In this case, installed state will be reached by first call of [installIfNeeded] without executing
 * package manager.
 *
 * Resolution will be used from [NpmDependency] by calling [getNpmDependencyResolvedCompilation].
 * Also resolution will be checked before calling [NpmProject.require] and executing any task
 * that requires npm dependencies or node_modules.
 *
 * User can call [requireInstalled] to get resolution info.
 *
 * ## Resolving process during Idea import
 *
 * In this case [forceFullResolve] will be set, and all compilations will be resolved
 * even without `packageJson` task execution.
 *
 * During building gradle project model, all [NpmDependency] will be asked for there files,
 * and [getNpmDependencyResolvedCompilation] will be called. In the [forceFullResolve] mode
 * project will be fully resolved: all `package.json` files will be created, and package manager
 * will be called. We are manually tracking package.json files contents to avoid calling package manager
 * if nothing was changes.
 *
 * Note that in this case resolution process will be performed outside of task execution.
