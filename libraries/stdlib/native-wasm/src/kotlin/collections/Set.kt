/**
 * A generic unordered collection of unique elements. The interface allows checking if an element is contained by it
 * and iterating over all elements. Complex operations are built upon this functionality
 * and provided in form of [kotlin.collections] extension functions.
 *
 * It is implementation-specific how [Set] defines element's uniqueness. If not stated otherwise, [Set] implementations are usually
 * distinguishing elements using [Any.equals]. However, it is not the only way to distinguish elements, and some implementations may use
 * referential equality or compare elements by some of their properties. It is recommended to explicitly specify how a class
 * implementing [Set] distinguish elements.
 *
 * Methods in this interface support only read-only access to the set;
 * read/write access is supported through the [MutableSet] interface.
 *
 * Unlike [List], [Set] does not guarantee any particular order for iteration. However, particular implementations
 * are free to have fixed iteration order, like "smaller", in some sense, elements are visited prior to "larger". In this case,
 * it is recommended to explicitly document ordering guarantees for the [Set] implementation.
 *
 * Unlike [Collection] implementations, [Set] implementations must override [Any.toString], [Any.equals] and [Any.hashCode] functions
 * and provide implementations such that:
 * - [Set.toString] should return a string containing string representation of contained elements in iteration order.
 * - [Set.equals] should consider two sets equal if and only if they contain the same number of elements and each element
 *   from one set is contained in another set. Unlike some other `equals` implementations, [Set.equals]
 *   should consider two sets equal even if they are instances of different classes; the only requirement here is that both sets have
 *   to implement [Set] interface.
 * - [Set.hashCode] should be computed as a sum of elements' hash codes using the following algorithm:
 *   ```kotlin
 *   var hashCode: Int = 0
 *   for (element in this) hashCode += element.hashCode()
 *   ```
 *
 * @param E the type of elements contained in the set. The set is covariant in its element type.
