 * Core abstraction of Platform API, represents a collection of platforms.
 *
 * This is the primarily abstraction intended to use in the most part of API, as, usually,
 * pretty much anything that may have a platform, may have a several platforms as well in the
 * context of multiplatform projects.
 *
 * Please, use it over the [SimplePlatform] unless you're absolutely sure what you're doing.
 *
 * NB. Even in cases, where some part of logic makes sense only for a particular platform (e.g., JVM),
 * it still can be applicable for [TargetPlatform]s with [componentPlatforms] > 1, e.g. when it consists
 * of two version of JDK, JDK and Android, several versions of Android API, etc.

 * - direct inheritors are well-known and represent three major platforms supported at the moment (JVM, JS, Native)
 *
 * - exact enumeration of all inheritors isn't available at the compile time, see [CommonPlatforms]
 *
 * - each implementation should support equality in a broad sense of "absolutely the same platform"
 *
 * - it is _prohibited_ to create instances of [SimplePlatform] in the client's code, use respective factory instance (e.g., [JvmPlatforms])
 *  to get instances of platforms
 *
 * Ideally, each specific subtype should be either a data class or singleton.
