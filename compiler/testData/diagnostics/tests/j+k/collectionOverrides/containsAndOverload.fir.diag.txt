/main.kt:(71,79): error: This function accidentally overrides both 'fun contains(x: String!): Boolean' defined in '/A' and a function with erased parameters 'fun contains(x: Any!): Boolean' defined in '/A' from JVM point of view because of mixed Java/Kotlin hierarchy.
This situation provokes a JVM clash and is forbidden. To fix it, delete either this or one of the overridden functions.
