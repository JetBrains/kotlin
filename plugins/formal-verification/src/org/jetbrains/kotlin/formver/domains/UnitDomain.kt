/** A representation of the unit type as a Viper domain.
 *
 * We would typically expect a unit type to have only one element, but it doesn't seem possible (or at
 * least easy) to ensure this in Viper: even an axiom of the form `x: Unit, y: Unit :: x == y` doesn't
 * seem to suffice (hence why it is not present here).  It isn't quite clear why this is the case, but
 * since we don't generally need to talk about equality of units this should be fine.
