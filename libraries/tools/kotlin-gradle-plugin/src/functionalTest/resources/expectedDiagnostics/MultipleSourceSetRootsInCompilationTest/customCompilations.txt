[KotlinDefaultHierarchyFallbackDependsOnUsageDetected | WARNING] The Default Kotlin Hierarchy Template was not applied to 'root project 'customCompilations'':
Explicit .dependsOn() edges were configured for the following source sets:
[jvmIntegrationTest, linuxX64IntegrationTest]

Consider removing dependsOn-calls or disabling the default template by adding
    'kotlin.mpp.applyDefaultHierarchyTemplate=false'
to your gradle.properties

[MultipleSourceSetRootsInCompilation | WARNING] Kotlin Source Sets: 'commonIntegrationTest', 'jvmIntegrationTest2'
are included to 'integrationTest' compilation of 'jvm' target.
However, they have no common source set root between them.

Please remove these kotlin source sets and include their source directories to the compilation's default source set.

    kotlin.sourceSets["jvmIntegrationTest"].kotlin.srcDir() // <-- pass sources directories here

Or, if the solution above is not applicable, specify `dependsOn` edges between these source sets so that there are no multiple roots.
See https://kotl.in/connecting-source-sets for more details.
