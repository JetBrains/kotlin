## JS translation helpers

This module contains helpers for performing AST-level optimizations on the generated JavaScript code.
They are invoked by the Kotlin/JS backend after code generation.

Also, for historical reasons, this directory contains Kotlin/JS specific test data files (in the `testData` subdirectory).
