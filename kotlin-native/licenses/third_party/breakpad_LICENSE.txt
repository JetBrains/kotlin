Version 2.0 - August 6, 2003

Please read this License carefully before downloading this software. By
downloading or using this software, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms
of this License. If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this License,
please do not download or use the software.

Apple Note: In January 2007, Apple changed its corporate name from "Apple
Computer, Inc." to "Apple Inc." This change has been reflected below and
copyright years updated, but no other changes have been made to the APSL 2.0.

1. General; Definitions. This License applies to any program or other work which Apple Inc. ("Apple") makes publicly available and which contains a notice placed by Apple identifying such program or work as "Original Code" and stating that it is subject to the terms of this Apple Public Source License version 2.0 ("License"). As used in this License:

1.1 "Applicable Patent Rights" mean: (a) in the case where Apple is the
grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired,
owned by or assigned to Apple and (ii) that cover subject matter contained in
the Original Code, but only to the extent necessary to use, reproduce and/or
distribute the Original Code without infringement; and (b) in the case where
You are the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter
acquired, owned by or assigned to You and (ii) that cover subject matter in
Your Modifications, taken alone or in combination with Original Code.

1.2 "Contributor" means any person or entity that creates or contributes to
the creation of Modifications.

1.3 "Covered Code" means the Original Code, Modifications, the combination of
Original Code and any Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof.

1.4 "Externally Deploy" means: (a) to sublicense, distribute or otherwise make
Covered Code available, directly or indirectly, to anyone other than You;
and/or (b) to use Covered Code, alone or as part of a Larger Work, in any way
to provide a service, including but not limited to delivery of content,
through electronic communication with a client other than You.

1.5 "Larger Work" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof
with code not governed by the terms of this License.

1.6 "Modifications" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change to, the
substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous Modifications,
the combination of Original Code and any previous Modifications, and/or any
respective portions thereof. When code is released as a series of files, a
Modification is: (a) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file
containing Covered Code; and/or (b) any new file or other representation of
computer program statements that contains any part of Covered Code.

1.7 "Original Code" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other work as
originally made available by Apple under this License, including the Source
Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs or works made available by
Apple under this License, and that has been expressly identified by Apple as
such in the header file(s) of such work; and (b) the object code compiled from
such Source Code and originally made available by Apple under this License

1.8 "Source Code" means the human readable form of a program or other work
that is suitable for making modifications to it, including all modules it
contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to
control compilation and installation of an executable (object code).

1.9 "You" or "Your" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
under this License. For legal entities, "You" or "Your" includes any entity
which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, You, where
"control" means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership
of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial
ownership of such entity.

2. Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of Apple&apos;s Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following:

2.1 Unmodified Code. You may use, reproduce, display, perform, internally
distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy verbatim,
unmodified copies of the Original Code, for commercial or non-commercial
purposes, provided that in each instance:

(a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright
and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear in the
Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to
this License; and

(b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of
Covered Code and documentation You distribute or Externally Deploy, and You
may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict
this License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder, except as permitted
under Section 6.

2.2 Modified Code. You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce, display,
perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy
Your Modifications and Covered Code, for commercial or non-commercial
purposes, provided that in each instance You also meet all of these
conditions:

(a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the
Source Code of the Covered Code;

(b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in
Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause
the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the
files and the date of any change; and

(c) If You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make Source Code of
all Your Externally Deployed Modifications either available to those to whom
You have Externally Deployed Your Modifications, or publicly available. Source
Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications must be released under the
terms set forth in this License, including the license grants set forth in
Section 3 below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or
twelve (12) months from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is
longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Externally
Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site).

2.3 Distribution of Executable Versions. In addition, if You Externally Deploy
Covered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications) in object code, executable
form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as
in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is
available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to
obtain such Source Code.

2.4 Third Party Rights. You expressly acknowledge and agree that although
Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of
the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any
Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other
intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor
disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if
any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to
distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license
before distributing the Covered Code.

3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under this License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Apple&apos;s licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.

4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof.

5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.

6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient&apos;s agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.

7. Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE&apos;S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "APPLE" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple&apos;s total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names "Apple", "Mac", "Mac OS", "QuickTime", "QuickTime Streaming Server" or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively "Apple Marks") or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor. You agree not to use any Apple Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Code or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple&apos;s third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.

11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple ("Apple Modifications"), and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.

12. Termination.

12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate:

(a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any
term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
becoming aware of such breach;

(b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section
13.5(b); or

(c) automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the
term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against
Apple; provided that Apple did not first commence an action for patent
infringement against You in that instance.

12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop
any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of
the Covered Code. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly
granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License.
Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the
termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to
Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other
for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of
terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this
License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.

13. Miscellaneous.

13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as defined
in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered
Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined
in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and
software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212
(Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR
252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in
Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly,
all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set
forth herein.

13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating
an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association
between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent to
the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.

13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple&apos;s
right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or
distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions
as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or
products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.

13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce any
provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of
that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the
language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply
to this License.

13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction
finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable,
that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent
permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties,
and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You
from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents
the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately
terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and
destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.

13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between
You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern
District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal
jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that
District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
excluded.

13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of
California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law.

Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause
applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License
and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exigÃ© que le
prÃ©sent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rÃ©digÃ©s en anglais.

          The "Clarified Artistic License"

            Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

   "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
   Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
   created through textual modification.

   "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
   modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
   of the Copyright Holder as specified below.

   "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
   copyrights for the package.

   "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
   this Package.

   "Distribution fee" is a fee you charge for providing a copy of this
   Package to another party.

   "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the right to use
   the item, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain, or those made Freely Available, or from
the Copyright Holder.  A Package modified in such a way shall still be
considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
following:

    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
    site allowing unrestricted access to them, or by allowing the Copyright
    Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the
    Package.

    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

    e) permit and encourge anyone who receives a copy of the modified Package
    permission to make your modifications Freely Available in some specific
    way.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
    to get the Standard Version.

    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    the Package with your modifications.

    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

    e) offer the machine-readable source of the Package, with your
    modifications, by mail order.

5. You may charge a distribution fee for any distribution of this Package.
If you offer support for this Package, you may charge any fee you choose
for that support.  You may not charge a license fee for the right to use
this Package itself.  You may distribute this Package in aggregate with
other (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) programs as part of a
larger (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) software distribution,
and charge license fees for other parts of that software distribution,
provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.
If the Package includes an interpreter, You may embed this Package's
interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be
construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete
Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
Package.

7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
regression tests for the language.

8. Aggregation of the Standard Version of the Package with a commercial
distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is
embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's
interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution.
Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

AUTOCONF CONFIGURE SCRIPT EXCEPTION

Version 3.0, 18 August 2009

Copyright Â© 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

This Exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General
Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file that bears a
notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is
governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

The purpose of this Exception is to allow distribution of Autoconf&apos;s
typical output under terms of the recipient&apos;s choice (including
proprietary).

0. Definitions.
"Covered Code" is the source or object code of a version of Autoconf that is a
covered work under this License.

"Normally Copied Code" for a version of Autoconf means all parts of its
Covered Code which that version can copy from its code (i.e., not from its
input file) into its minimally verbose, non-debugging and non-tracing output.

"Ineligible Code" is Covered Code that is not Normally Copied Code.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.
You have permission to propagate output of Autoconf, even if such propagation
would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3. However, if by modifying Autoconf
you cause any Ineligible Code of the version you received to become Normally
Copied Code of your modified version, then you void this Exception for the
resulting covered work. If you convey that resulting covered work, you must
remove this Exception in accordance with the second paragraph of Section 7 of
GPLv3.

2. No Weakening of Autoconf Copyleft.
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that
third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license
of Autoconf.

License for Autotools

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Autoconf Exception

As a special exception, the Free Software Foundation gives unlimited
permission to copy, distribute and modify the configure scripts that are the
output of Autoconf. You need not follow the terms of the GNU General Public
License when using or distributing such scripts, even though portions of the
text of Autoconf appear in them. The GNU General Public License (GPL) does
govern all other use of the material that constitutes the Autoconf program.

Certain portions of the Autoconf source text are designed to be copied (in
certain cases, depending on the input) into the output of Autoconf. We call
these the "data" portions. The rest of the Autoconf source text consists of
comments plus executable code that decides which of the data portions to
output in any given case. We call these comments and executable code the "non-
data" portions. Autoconf never copies any of the non-data portions into its
output.

This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autoconf released by
the Free Software Foundation. When you make and distribute a modified version
of Autoconf, you may extend this special exception to the GPL to apply to your
modified version as well, *unless* your modified version has the potential to
copy into its output some of the text that was the non-data portion of the
version that you started with. (In other words, unless your change moves or
copies text from the non-data portions to the data portions.) If your
modification has such potential, you must delete any notice of this special
exception to the GPL from your modified version.
