     * This annotation indicates that the exported declaration should be exported as `default` on the JS platform.
     *
     * In ES modules, the annotated declaration is available as the `default` export.
     * In CommonJS, UMD, and plain modules, the annotated declaration is available under the name `default`.
     *
     * This annotation is experimental, meaning that the restrictions described above are subject to change.
     *
     * Note: If the annotation is applied multiple times across the project, the behavior depends on the compilation granularity.
     * 
     * - **Whole-program compilation**: If multiple libraries apply the annotation, it results in a runtime error.
     * - **Per-module compilation**: Conflicts across dependencies (like in `whole-program` mode) are resolved.
     *   However, a runtime error occurs if the annotation is applied multiple times within a single module.
     * - **Per-file compilation**: This mode resolves the issues present in `whole-program` and `per-module` modes.
     *   However, a new issue arises if `@JsExport.Default` is applied multiple times within the same file.

 * Denotes an `external` declaration that must be imported from JavaScript module.
 *
 * The annotation can be used on top-level external declarations (classes, properties, functions) and files.
 * In case of file (which can't be `external`) the following rule applies: all the declarations in
 * the file must be `external`. By applying `@JsModule(...)` on a file you tell the compiler to import a JavaScript object
 * that contains all the declarations from the file.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * @JsModule("jquery")
 * external abstract class JQuery() {
 *     // some declarations here
 * }
 *
 * @JsModule("jquery")
 * external fun JQuery(element: Element): JQuery
 * ```
 *
 * @property import name of a module to import declaration from.
 *           It is not interpreted by the Kotlin compiler, it's passed as is directly to the target module system.

/**
 * Adds prefix to `external` declarations in a source file.
 *
 * JavaScript does not have a concept of packages (namespaces). They are usually emulated by nested objects.
 * The compiler turns references to `external` declarations either to plain unprefixed names
 * or to plain imports.
 * However, if a JavaScript library provides its declarations in packages, you won't be satisfied with this.
 * You can tell the compiler to generate additional prefix before references to `external` declarations using the `@JsQualifier(...)`
 * annotation.
 *
 * Note that a file marked with the `@JsQualifier(...)` annotation can't contain non-`external` declarations.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * @file:JsQualifier("my.jsPackageName")
 * package some.kotlinPackage
 *
 * external fun foo(x: Int)
 *
 * external fun bar(): String
 * ```
 *
 * @property value the qualifier to add to the declarations in the generated code.
 *           It must be a sequence of valid JavaScript identifiers separated by the `.` character.
 *           Examples of valid qualifiers are: `foo`, `bar.Baz`, `_.$0.f`.
 *
 * @see JsModule
