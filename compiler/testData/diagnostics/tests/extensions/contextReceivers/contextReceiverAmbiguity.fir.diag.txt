/contextReceiverAmbiguity.fir.kt:(141,148): warning: Experimental context receivers are deprecated and will be superseded by context parameters.
Kotlin compiler version 2.2 will be the last version that supports context receivers.
Consider migrating to extension receivers or regular parameters now.
Alternatively, migrate directly to context parameters when Kotlin 2.2 is released.

See the context parameters proposal for more details: https://kotl.in/context-parameters
This warning will become an error in future releases.
