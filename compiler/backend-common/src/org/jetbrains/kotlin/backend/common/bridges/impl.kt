/**
 * An implementation of FunctionHandle based on descriptors.
 *
 * This implementation workarounds a minor inconvenience in descriptor hierarchy regarding traits with implementations.
 * Consider the following hierarchy:
 *
 * trait A { fun foo() = 42 }
 * class B : A
 *
 * In terms of descriptors, we'll have a declaration in trait A with modality=OPEN and a fake override in class B with modality=OPEN.
 * For the purposes of bridge generation though, it's much easier to "move" all implementations out of traits into their child classes,
 * i.e. treat the function in A as a declaration with modality=ABSTRACT and a function in B as a _declaration_ with modality=OPEN.
 *
 * This provides us with the nice invariant that all implementations (concrete declarations) are always in classes. This means we _always_
 * can generate a bridge near an implementation (of course, in case it has a super-declaration with a different signature). Ultimately this
 * eases the process of determining what bridges are already generated in our supertypes and need to be inherited, not regenerated.
