// Note:
// Right now we don't want to have neither 'volatile' nor 'synchronized' at runtime,
// so they annotated as `external` to avoid warnings/errors from some minifiers.
// They was reserved word in ECMAScript 2, but is not since ECMAScript 5.

// Additional note:
// Although it's reasonable to mark these annotations as `@native` (`external` since 1.1),
// we prohibit marking annotations this way.
// TODO: Another workaround is required to remove these annotations from kotlin.js
