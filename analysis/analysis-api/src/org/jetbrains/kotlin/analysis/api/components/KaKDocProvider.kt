     *
     * [KaKDocComment] for the given [KtElement] is resolved using the following algorithm:
     *
     * 1. [KtElement] is a [KtDeclaration] with a KDoc, i.e. [KtDeclaration.getDocComment] returns non-null value.
     * In this case, [KaKDocComment.primaryTag] is the KDoc's default section and [KaKDocComment.additionalSections]
     * contain all sections of that KDoc (including the default one).
     *
     * 2. [KtElement] does not have its own KDoc, but its documentation can be derived from its parent's KDoc.
     * This rule is applied in four different cases:
     *
     *         - [KtElement] is a primary constructor and the enclosing class KDoc has a `@constructor` section.
     *         That section is used as [KaKDocComment.primaryTag], and [KaKDocComment.additionalSections] contains
     *         the sections that include `@param` tags from the class's KDoc.
     *
     *         - [KtElement] is a [KtParameter] of the primary constructor. [KaKDocComment.primaryTag] is resolved
     *         from the `@property` or `@param` tags of the class's KDoc. [KaKDocComment.additionalSections] is empty.
     *
     *         - [KtElement] is a [KtParameter] or [KtTypeParameter]. [KaKDocComment.primaryTag] is resolved
     *         from the `@param` tags of the parent's KDoc. [KaKDocComment.additionalSections] is empty.
     *
     *         - [KtElement] is a [KtProperty] that is declared inside a class/object with a KDoc, but referenced
     *         with a `@property` tag in the class/object KDoc. [KaKDocComment.primaryTag] is the `@property` tag,
     *         and [KaKDocComment.additionalSections] is empty.
     *
     *  3. In all other cases this method returns `null`
     *
     * Notes:
     * - KDoc for an element can be resolved whenever we have sources for it. Including external libraries.
     * - This method only resolves KDoc for Kotlin elements. Java elements and Javadoc are not supported.
