/**
 * This example implements the famous "99 Bottles of Beer" program
 * See http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/
 *
 * The point is to print out a song with the following lyrics:
 *
 *     The "99 bottles of beer" song
 *
 *     99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
 *     Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
 *
 *     98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
 *     Take one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.
 *
 *       ...
 *
 *     2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.
 *     Take one down, pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.
 *
 *     1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
 *     Take one down, pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.
 *
 *     No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
 *     Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
 *
 * Additionally, you can pass the desired initial number of bottles to use (rather than 99)
 * as a command-line argument
