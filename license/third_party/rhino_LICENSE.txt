AMENDMENTS

The Netscape Public License Version 1.1 ("NPL") consists of the
Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 with the following Amendments,

"Exhibit A-Netscape Public License" are governed by the Netscape
Public License Version 1.1.

Additional Terms applicable to the Netscape Public License.

    I. Effect.

       These additional terms described in this Netscape Public
       License -- Amendments shall apply to the Mozilla Communicator
       client code and to all Covered Code under this License.

   II. ''Netscape's Branded Code'' means Covered Code that Netscape
       distributes and/or permits others to distribute under one or
       more trademark(s) which are controlled by Netscape but which
       are not licensed for use under this License.

  III. Netscape and logo.

       This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks
       "Netscape'', the "Netscape N and horizon'' logo or the
       "Netscape lighthouse" logo, "Netcenter", "Gecko", "Java" or
       "JavaScript", "Smart Browsing" even if such marks are included
       in the Original Code or Modifications.

   IV. Inability to Comply Due to Contractual Obligation.

       Prior to licensing the Original Code under this License,
       Netscape has licensed third party code for use in Netscape's
       Branded Code. To the extent that Netscape is limited
       contractually from making such third party code available under
       this License, Netscape may choose to reintegrate such code into
       Covered Code without being required to distribute such code in
       Source Code form, even if such code would otherwise be
       considered ''Modifications'' under this License.

    V. Use of Modifications and Covered Code by Initial Developer.

        V.1. In General.

             The obligations of Section 3 apply to Netscape, except to
             the extent specified in this Amendment, Section V.2 and
             V.3.

        V.2. Other Products.

             Netscape may include Covered Code in products other than
             the Netscape's Branded Code which are released by
             Netscape during the two (2) years following the release
             date of the Original Code, without such additional
             products becoming subject to the terms of this License,
             and may license such additional products on different
             terms from those contained in this License.

        V.3. Alternative Licensing.

             Netscape may license the Source Code of Netscape's
             Branded Code, including Modifications incorporated
             therein, without such Netscape Branded Code becoming
             subject to the terms of this License, and may license
             such Netscape Branded Code on different terms from those
             contained in this License.

    VI. Litigation.

        Notwithstanding the limitations of Section 11 above, the
        provisions regarding litigation in Section 11(a), (b) and (c)
        of the License shall apply to all disputes relating to this
        License.

        Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of
        Modifications made by that Contributor.


3. Distribution Obligations.

    3.1. Application of License.

    The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
    governed by the terms of this License, including without
    limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code
    may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
    future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You
    must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source
    Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any
    Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
    version of this License or the recipients' rights
    hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
    offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

    3.2. Availability of Source Code.

    Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must
    be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this
    License either on the same media as an Executable version or via
    an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom
    you made an Executable version available; and if made available
    via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for
    at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
    available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version
    of that particular Modification has been made available to such
    recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
    version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
    Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

    3.3. Description of Modifications.

    You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain
    a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered
    Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
    statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
    indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer
    and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source
    Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
    documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
    Covered Code.

    3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

        (a) Third Party Claims.

        If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third
        party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise
        the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or
        2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
        distribution titled "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the
        party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
        will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
        knowledge after the Modification is made available as
        described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify
        the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
        thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
        appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated
        to inform those who received the Covered Code that new
        knowledge has been obtained.

        (b) Contributor APIs.

        If Contributor's Modifications include an application
        programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent
        licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,
        Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL
        file.

        (c)    Representations.

        Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
        Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
        Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
        Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
        by this License.


    3.5. Required Notices.

    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the
    Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a
    particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
    include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)
    where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You
    created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a
    Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also
    duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code
    where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating
    to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee
    for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one
    or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on
    Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
    Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such
    warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
    You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
    and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
    Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability terms You offer.

    3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
    requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered
    Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
    version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this
    License, including a description of how and where You have
    fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be
    conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,
    related documentation or collateral in which You describe
    recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may
    distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership
    rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
    different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
    with the terms of this License and that the license for the
    Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
    recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set
    forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version
    under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that
    any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,
    not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree
    to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
    a result of any such terms You offer.

    3.7. Larger Works.

    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other
    code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
    Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
    sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
    Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of
    this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due
    to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a)
    comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
    possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
    affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
    described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
    distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited
    by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
    detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
    understand it.

5. Application of this License.

    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
    attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

    6.1. New Versions.

    Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish
    revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each
    version will be given a distinguishing version number.

    6.2. Effect of New Versions.

    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
    the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of
    that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under
    the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
    Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the
    terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

    6.3. Derivative Works.

    If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you
    may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
    Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your
    license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'',
    ''Netscape'', "MPL", ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do
    not appear in your license (except to note that your license
    differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that
    Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
    Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in
    the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in
    the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be
    deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS
    FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
    NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
    OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE
    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
    ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS
    AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

    8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
    breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly
    granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions
    which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
    termination of this License shall survive.

    8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent
    infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against
    Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or
    Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
    "Participant") alleging that:

    (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
    Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
    shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
    prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice
    You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
    agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of
    Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
    litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
    such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable
    royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in
    writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,
    the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
    2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice
    period specified above.

    (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such
    Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly
    infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such
    Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective
    as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had
    made, Modifications made by that Participant.

    8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against
    Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version
    directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is
    resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
    initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
    value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections
    2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount
    or value of any payment or license.

    8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
    all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and
    resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any
    distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
    termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
    COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO
    ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
    FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
    MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,
    EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO
    LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
    NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
    EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

    The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined
    in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial
    computer software'' and ''commercial computer software
    documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
    (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
    C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
    U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
    rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed
    by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law,
    if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law
    provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party
    is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do
    business in the United States of America, any litigation relating
    to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the
    Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue
    lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party
    responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs
    and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of
    the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
    Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
    provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
    against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
    indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
    and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
    distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
    herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
    of liability.

	  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
	     Version 2, June 1991

   Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
   51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

	    Preamble

    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
  using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
  the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
  your programs, too.

    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
  you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
  source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
  rights.

    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
  distribute and/or modify the software.

    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
  software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
  authors' reputations.

    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
  program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.

	  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
  under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
  refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
  the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
  along with the Program.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
      parties under the terms of this License.

      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Program.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.

    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
      customarily used for software interchange; or,

      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
      received the program in object code or executable form with such
      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
  control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
  special exception, the source code distributed need not include
  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
  itself accompanies the executable.

  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
  parties remain in full compliance.

    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Program or works based on it.

    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
  this License.

    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
  circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.

    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
  countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
  address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
  later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
  Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
  Foundation.

    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
  to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
  make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

	    NO WARRANTY

    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

	   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
      the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
      (at your option) any later version.

      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
      GNU General Public License for more details.

      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
      with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
      51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
  when it starts in an interactive mode:

      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
  be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
    `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

    <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
    Ty Coon, President of Vice

  This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
  proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
  library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
  Public License instead of this License.
