/**
 * A generic collection of elements. The interface allows iterating over contained elements
 * and checking whether something is contained within the collection. Complex operations are built upon this
 * functionality and provided in form of [kotlin.collections] extension functions.
 *
 * Functions in this interface support only read-only access to the collection;
 * read/write access is supported through the [MutableCollection] interface.
 *
 * [Collection] is a top-level interface for objects aggregating multiple different homogenous elements. Other more specific interfaces,
 * like [List], [Set], and [Map] extend [Collection] to provide more specific guarantees on how elements are stored and accessed, as well
 * as provide richer functionality.
 *
 * [Collection] implementation may have different guarantees on the order and uniqueness of contained elements,
 * for example, elements contained in a [List] are ordered and could contain duplicates, while elements contained in
 * a [Set] may not contain duplicates and there is no particular order imposed on them.
 *
 * [Collection.contains] behavior is implementation-specific, but usually, it uses [Any.equals] to compare elements
 * for equality.
 *
 * [Collection] does not impose any requirements for [toString], [equals] and [hashCode] functions
 * and implementations are free to inherit a default behavior.
 * More specialized interfaces extending [Collection] (like [List], [Set] and [Map]) may impose stricter requirements.
 *
 * @param E the type of elements contained in the collection. The collection is covariant in its element type.
